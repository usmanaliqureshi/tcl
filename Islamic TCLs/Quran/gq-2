Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verse of the Scripture that maketh plain.
Lo! We have revealed it, a Lecture in Arabic, that ye may understand.
We narrate unto thee (Muhammad) the best of narratives in that We have inspired in thee this Quran, though aforetime thou wast of the heedless.
When Joseph said unto his father: O my father! Lo! I saw in a dream eleven planets and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating themselves unto me.
He said: O my dear son! Tell not thy brethren of thy vision, lest they plot a plot against thee. Lo! Satan is for man an open foe.
Thus thy Lord will prefer thee and will teach thee the interpretation of events, and will perfect His grace upon thee and upon the family of Jacob as He perfected it upon thy forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Lo! thy Lord is Knower, Wise.
Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs (of Allahs Sovereignty) for the inquiring.
When they said: Verily Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, many though we be. Lo! our father is in plain aberration.
(One said): Kill Joseph or cast him to some (other) land, so that your fathers favour may be all for you, and (that) ye may afterward be righteous folk.
One among them said: Kill not Joseph but, if ye must be doing, fling him into the depth of the pit; some caravan will find him.
They said: O our father! Why wilt thou not trust us with Joseph, when lo! we are good friends to him ?
Send him with us to-morrow that he may enjoy himself and play. And lo! we shall take good care of him.
He said: Lo! in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you, and I fear less the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him.
They said: If the wolf should devour him when we are (so strong) a band, then surely we should have already perished.
Then, when they led him off, and were of one mind that they should place him in the depth of the pit, We inspired in him: Thou wilt tell them of this deed of theirs when they know (thee) not.
And they came weeping to their father in the evening.
Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another, and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf devoured him, and thou believest not our saying even when we speak the truth.
And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought in that (predicament) which ye describe.
And there came a caravan, and they sent their waterdrawer. He let down his pail (into the pit). He said: Good luck! Here is a youth. And they hid him as a treasure, and Allah was Aware of what they did.
And they sold him for a low price, a number of silver coins; and they attached no value to him.
And he of Egypt who purchased him said unto his wife: Receive him honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son. Thus we established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah was predominant in His career, but most of mankind know not.
And And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We reward the good.
And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the doors and said: Come! He said: I seek refuge in Allah! Lo! he is my lord, who hath treated me honourably. Lo! wrong-doers never prosper.
She verily desired him, and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness. Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves.
And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they met her lord and master at the door. She said: What shall be his reward, who wisheth evil to thy folk, save prison or a painful doom ?
(Joseph) said: She it was who asked of me an evil act. And a witness of her own folk testified: If his shirt is torn from before, then she speaketh truth and he is of the liars.
And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she hath lied and he is of the truthful.
So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said: Lo! this is of the guile of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great.
O Joseph! Turn away from this, and thou, (O woman), ask forgiveness for thy sin. Lo! thou art of the faulty.
And women in the city said: The rulers wife is asking of her slave-boy an ill-deed. Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in plain aberration.
And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them and prepared for them a cushioned couch (to lie on at the feast) and gave to every one of them a knife and said (to Joseph): Come out unto them! And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, exclaiming: Allah Blameless! This is no a human being. This is not other than some gracious angel.
She said: This is he on whose account ye blamed me. I asked of him an evil act, but he proved continent, but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall be of those brought low.
He said: O my Lord! Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me, and if Thou fend not off their wiles from me I shall incline unto them and become of the foolish.
So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is Hearer, Knower.
And it seemed good to them (the men-folk) after they had seen the signs (of his innocence) to imprison him for a time.
And two young men went to prison with him. One of them said: I dreamed that I was pressing wine. The other said: I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Announce unto us the interpretation, for we see thee of those good (at interpretation).
He said: The food which ye are given (daily) shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you. This is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter.
And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to Allah. This is of the bounty of Allah unto us (the seed of Abraham) and unto mankind; but most men give not thanks.
O my fellow-prisoners! Are divers lords better, or Allah the One, Almighty ?
Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers. Allah hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with Allah only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the right religion, but most men know not.
O my two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire.
And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released: Mention me in the presence of thy lord. But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord, so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years.
And the king said: Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating, and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry. O notables! Expound for me my vision, if ye can interpret dreams.
They answered: Jumbled dreams! And we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams.
And he of the two who was released, and (now) at length remembered, said: I am going to announce unto you the interpretation, therefore send me forth.
(And when he came to Joseph in the prison, he exclaimed): Joseph! O thou truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry, that I may return unto the people, so that they may know.
He said: Ye shall sow seven years as usual, but that which ye reap, leave it in the ear, all save a little which ye eat.
Then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that ye have prepared for them, save a little of that which ye have stored.
Then, after that, will come a year when the people will have plenteous crops and when they will press (wine and oil).
And the king said: Bring him unto me. And when the messenger came unto him, he (Joseph) said: Return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the women who cut their hands. Lo! my Lord knoweth their guile.
He (the king) (then sent for those women and) said: What happened when ye asked an evil act of Joseph ? They answered: Allah Blameless! We know no evil of him. Said the wife of the ruler: Now the truth is out. I asked of him an evil act, and he is surely of the truthful.
(Then Joseph said: I asked for) this, that he (my lord) may know that I betrayed him not in secret, and that surely Allah guideth not the snare of the betrayers.
I do not exculpate myself. Lo! the (human) soul enjoineth unto evil, save that whereon my Lord hath mercy. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.
And the king said: Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person. And when he had talked with him he said: Lo! thou art to-day in our presence established and trusted.
He said: Set me over the storehouses of the land. Lo! I am a skilled custodian.
Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land. He was the owner of it where he pleased. We reach with Our mercy whom We will. We lose not the reward of the good.
And the reward of the Hereafter is better, for those who believe and ward off (evil).
And Josephs brethren came and presented themselves before him, and he knew them but they knew him not.
And when he provided them with their provision he said: Bring unto me a brother of yours from your father. See ye not that I fill up the measure and I am the best of hosts ?
And if ye bring him not unto me, then there shall be no measure for you with me, nor shall ye draw near.
They said: We will try to win him from his father: that we will surely do.
He said unto his young men: Place their merchandise in their saddlebags, so that they may know it when they go back to their folk, and so will come again.
So when they went back to their father they said: O our father! The measure is denied us, so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure, surely we will guard him well.
He said: Can I entrust him to you save as I entrusted his brother to you aforetime ? Allah is better at guarding, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.
And when they opened their belongings they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them. They said: O our father! What (more) can we ask ? Here is our merchandise returned to us. We shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother, and we shall have the extra measure of a camel (load). This (that we bring now) is a light measure.
He said: I will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of Allah that ye will bring him back to me, unless ye are surrounded. And when they gave him their undertaking he said: Allah is the Warden over what we say.
And he said: O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I can naught avail you as against Allah. Lo! the decision rests with Allah only. In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust.
And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it would have naught availed them as against Allah; it was but a need of Jacobs soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind know not.
And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother unto him, saying: Lo! I, even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did.
And when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup in his brothers saddlebag, and then a crier cried: O camel-riders! Lo! ye are surely thieves!
They cried, coming toward them: What is it ye have lost ?
They said: We have lost the kings cup, and he who bringeth it shall have a camel-load, and I (said Joseph) am answerable for it.
They said: By Allah, well ye know we came not to do evil in the land, and are no thieves.
They said: And what shall be the penalty for it, if ye prove liars ?
They said: The penalty for it! He in whose bag (the cup) is found, he is the penalty for it. Thus we requite wrong-doers.
Then he (Joseph) began the search with their bags before his brothers bag, then he produced it from his brothers bag. Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother according to the kings law unless Allah willed. We raise by grades (of mercy) whom We will, and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing.
They said: If he stealeth, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them. He said (within himself): Ye are in worse case, and Allah knoweth best (the truth of) that which ye allege.
They said: O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath a very aged father, so take one of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee of those who do kindness.
He said: Allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property; then truly we should be wrong-doers.
So, When they despaired of (moving) him, they conferred together apart. The eldest of them said: Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in Allahs name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime ? Therefore I shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or Allah judgeth for me. He is the Best of Judges.
Return unto your father and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We testify only to that which we know; we are not guardians of the Unseen.
Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled hither. Lo! we speak the truth.
(And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him) he said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience! It may be that Allah will bring them all unto me. Lo! He, only He, is the Knower, the Wise.
And he turned away from them and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing.
They said: By Allah, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish!
He said: I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not.
Go, O my sons, and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother, and despair not of the Spirit of Allah. Lo! none despaireth of the Spirit of Allah save disbelieving folk.
And when they came (again) before him (Joseph) they said: O ruler! Misfortune hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise, so fill for us the measure and be charitable unto us. Lo! Allah will requite the charitable,
He said: Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance ?
They said: Is it indeed thou who art Joseph ? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah hath shown us favour. Lo! he who wardeth off (evil) and endureth (findeth favour); for lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the kindly.
They said: By Allah, verily Allah hath preferred thee above us, and we were indeed sinful.
He said: Have no fear this day! May Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.
Go with this shirt of mine and lay it on my fathers face, he will become (again) a seer; and come to me with all your folk.
When the caravan departed their father had said: Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard.
(Those around him) said: By Allah, lo! thou art in thine old aberration.
Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid it on his face and he became a seer once more. He said: Said I not unto you that I know from Allah that which ye know not ?
They said: O our father! Ask forgiveness of our sins for us, for lo! we were sinful.
He said: I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
And when they came in before Joseph, he took his parents unto him, and said: Come into Egypt safe, if Allah will!
And he placed his parents on the dais and they fell down before him prostrate, and he said: O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream of old. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren. Lo! my Lord is tender unto whom He will. He is the Knower, the Wise.
O my Lord! Thou hast given me (something) of sovereignty and hast taught me (something) of the interpretation of events - Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protecting Guardian in the world and the Hereafter. Make me to die muslim (unto Thee), and join me to the righteous.
This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee (Muhammad). Thou wast not present with them when they fixed their plan and they were scheming.
And though thou try much, most men will not believe.
Thou askest them no fee for it. It is naught else than a reminder unto the peoples.
How many a portent is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by with face averted!
And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners (unto Him).
Deem they themselves secure from the coming on them of a pall of Allahs punishment, or the coming of the Hour suddenly while they are unaware ?
Say: This is my Way: I call on Allah with sure knowledge. I and whosoever followeth me - Glory be to Allah! - and I am not of the idolaters.
We sent not before thee (any messengers) save men whom We inspired from among the folk of the townships - Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them ? And verily the abode of the Hereafter, for those who ward off (evil), is best. Have ye then no sense ? -
Till, when the messengers despaired and thought that they were denied, then came unto them Our help, and whom We would was saved. And Our wrath cannot be warded from the guilty.
In their history verily there is a lesson for men of understanding. It is no invented story but a confirmation of the existing (Scripture) and a detailed explanation of everything, and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe.
Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture. That which is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, but most of mankind believe not.
Allah it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports, then mounted the Throne, and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service, each runneth unto an appointed term; He ordereth the course; He detaileth the revelations, that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.
And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and flowing streams, and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and female). He covereth the night with the day. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who take thought.
And in the Earth are neighbouring tracts, vineyards and ploughed lands, and date-palms, like and unlike, which are watered with one water. And we have made some of them to excel others in fruit. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who have sense.
And if thou wonderest, then wondrous is their saying: When we are dust, are we then forsooth (to be raised) in a new creation ? Such are they who disbelieve in their Lord; such have carcans on their necks; such are rightful owners of the Fire, they will abide therein.
And they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good, when exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them. But lo! thy Lord is rich in pardon for mankind despite their wrong, and lo! thy Lord is strong in punishment.
Those who disbelieve say: If only some portent were sent down upon him from his Lord! Thou art a warner only, and for every folk a guide.
Allah knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs absorb and that which they grow. And everything with Him is measured.
He is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Great, the High Exalted.
Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who noiseth it abroad, he who lurketh in the night and he who goeth freely in the daytime.
For him are angels ranged before him and behind him, who guard him by Allahs command. Lo! Allah changeth not the condition of a folk until they (first) change that which is in their hearts; and if Allah willeth misfortune for a folk there is none that can repel it, nor have they a defender beside Him.
He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the heavy clouds.
The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him. He launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they dispute (in doubt) concerning Allah, and He is mighty in wrath.
Unto Him is the real prayer. Those unto whom they pray beside Allah respond to them not at all, save as (is the response to) one who stretcheth forth his hands toward water (asking) that it may come unto his mouth, and it will never reach it. The prayer of disbelievers goeth (far) astray.
And unto Allah falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening hours.
Say (O Muhammad): Who is Lord of the heavens and the earth ? Say: Allah. Say: Take ye then (others) beside Him for protectors, which, even for themselves, have neither benefit nor hurt ? Say: Is the blind man equal to the seer, or is darkness equal to light ? Or assign they unto Allah partners who created the like of His creation so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them ? Say: Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Almighty.
He sendeth down water from the sky, so that valleys flow according to their measure, and the flood beareth (on its surface) swelling foam - from that which they smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth a foam like unto it - thus Allah coineth (the similitude of) the true and the false. Then, as for the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the banks, while, as for that which is of use to mankind, it remaineth in the earth. Thus Allah coineth the similitudes.
For those who answered Allahs call is bliss; and for those who answered not His call, if they had all that is in the earth, and therewith the like thereof, they would proffer it as ransom. Such will have a woeful reckoning, and their habitation will be hell, a dire abode.
Is he who knoweth that what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth like him who is blind ? But only men of understanding heed;
Such as keep the pact of Allah, and break not the covenant;
Such as unite that which Allah hath commandeth should be joined, and fear their Lord, and dread a woeful reckoning;
Such as persevere in seeking their Lords Countenance and are regular in prayer and spend of that which We bestow upon them secretly and openly, and overcome evil with good. Theirs will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home,
Gardens of Eden which they enter, along with all who do right of their fathers and their helpmeets and their seed. The angels enter unto them from every gate,
(Saying): Peace be unto you because ye persevered. Ah, passing sweet will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home.
And those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that which Allah hath commanded should be joined, and make mischief in the earth: theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode.
Allah enlargeth livelihood for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He will); and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of the world is but brief comfort as compared with the Hereafter.
Those who disbelieve say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his Lord! Say: Lo! Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth unto Himself all who turn (unto Him),
Who have believed and whose hearts have rest in the remembrance of Allah. Verily in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest!
Those who believe and do right: Joy is for them, and bliss (their) journeys end.
Thus We send thee (O Muhammad) unto a nation, before whom other nations have passed away, that thou mayst recite unto them that which We have inspired in thee, while they are disbelievers in the Beneficent. Say: He is my Lord; there is no God save Him. In Him do I put my trust and unto Him is my recourse.
Had it been possible for a Lecture to cause the mountains to move, or the earth to be torn asunder, or the dead to speak, (this Quran would have done so). Nay, but Allahs is the whole command. Do not those who believe know that, had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind ? As for those who disbelieve, disaster ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do, or it dwelleth near their home until the threat of Allah come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst.
And verily messengers (of Allah) were mocked before thee, but long I bore with those who disbelieved. At length I seized them, and how (awful) was My punishment!
Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul (as he who is aware of nothing) ? Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners. Say: Name them. Is it that ye would inform Him of something which He knoweth not in the earth ? Or is it but a way of speaking ? Nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve and they are kept from the right road. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.
For them is torment in the life of the world, and verily the doom of the Hereafter is more painful, and they have no defender from Allah.
A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty (to Allah): Underneath it rivers flow; its food is everlasting, and its shade; this is the reward of those who keep their duty, while the reward of disbelievers is the Fire.
Those unto whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in that which is revealed unto thee. And of the clans there are who deny some of it. Say: I am commanded only that I serve Allah and ascribe unto Him no partner. Unto Him I cry, and unto Him is my return.
Thus have We revealed it, a decisive utterance in Arabic; and if thou shouldst follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of knowledge, then truly wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting friend nor defender.
And verily We sent messengers (to mankind) before thee, and We appointed for them wives and offspring, and it was not (given) to any messenger that he should bring a portent save by Allahs leave. For everything there is a time prescribed.
Allah effaceth what He will, and establisheth (what He will), and with Him is the source of ordinance.
Whether We let thee see something of that which We have promised them, or make thee die (before its happening), thine is but conveyance (of the message). Ours the reckoning.
See they not how we aim to the land, reducing it of its outlying parts ? (When) Allah doometh there is none that can postpone His doom, and He is swift at reckoning.
Those who were before them plotted; but all plotting is Allahs. He knoweth that which each soul earneth. The disbelievers will come to know for whom will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home.
They who disbelieve say: Thou art no messenger (of Allah). Say: Allah, and whosoever hath knowledge of the Scripture, is sufficient witness between me and you.
Alif. Lam. Ra. (This is) a Scripture which We have revealed unto thee (Muhammad) that thereby thou mayst bring forth mankind from darkness unto light, by the permission of their Lord, unto the path of the Mighty, the Owner of Praise,
Allah, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. and woe unto the disbelievers from an awful doom;
Those who love the life of the world more than the Hereafter, and debar (men) from the way of Allah and would have it crooked: such are far astray.
And We never sent a messenger save with the language of his folk, that he might make (the message) clear for them. Then Allah sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth whom He will. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
We verily sent Moses with Our revelations, saying: Bring thy people forth from darkness unto light. And remind them of the days of Allah. Lo! therein are revelations for each steadfast, thankful (heart).
And (remind them) how Moses said unto his people: Remember Allahs favour unto you when He delivered you from Pharaohs folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment, and were slaying your sons and sparing your women; that was a tremendous trial from your Lord.
And when your Lord proclaimed: If ye give thanks, I will give you more; but if ye are thankless, lo! My punishment is dire.
And Moses said: Though ye and all who are in the earth prove thankless, lo! Allah verily is Absolute, Owner of Praise.
Hath not the history of those before you reached you: the folk of Noah, and (the tribes of) Aad and Thamud, and those after them ? None save Allah knoweth them. Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs, but they thrust their hands into their mouths, and said: Lo! we disbelieve in that wherewith ye have been sent, and lo! we are in grave doubt concerning that to which ye call us.
Their messengers said: Can there be doubt concerning Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth ? He calleth you that He may forgive you your sins and reprieve you unto an appointed term. They said: Ye are but mortals like us, who would fain turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring some clear warrant.
Their messengers said unto them: We are but mortals like you, but Allah giveth grace unto whom He will of His slaves. It is not ours to bring you a warrant unless by the permission of Allah. In Allah let believers put their trust!
How should we not put our trust in Allah when He hath shown us our ways ? We surely will endure the hurt ye do us. In Allah let the trusting put their trust.
And those who disbelieved said unto their messengers: Verily we will drive you out from our land, unless ye return to our religion. Then their Lord inspired them, (saying): Verily we shall destroy the wrong-doers,
And verily We shall make you to dwell in the land after them. This is for him who feareth My Majesty and feareth My threats.
And they sought help (from their Lord) and every froward potentate was bought to naught;
Hell is before him, and he is made to drink a festering water,
Which he sippeth but can hardly swallow, and death cometh unto him from every side while yet he cannot die, and before him is a harsh doom.
A similitude of those who disbelieve in their Lord: Their works are as ashes which the wind bloweth hard upon a stormy day. They have no control of aught that they have earned. That is the extreme failure.
Hast thou not seen that Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth ? If He will, He can remove you and bring (in) some new creation;
And that is no great matter for Allah.
They all come forth unto their Lord. Then those who were despised say unto those who were scornful: We were unto you a following, can ye then avert from us aught of Allahs doom ? They say: Had Allah guided us, we should have guided you. Whether we rage or patiently endure is (now) all one for us; we have no place of refuge.
And Satan saith, when the matter hath been decided: Lo! Allah promised you a promise of truth; and I promised you, then failed you. And I had no power over you save that I called unto you and ye obeyed me. So blame not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can ye help me, Lo! I disbelieved in that which ye before ascribed to me. Lo! for wrong-doers is a painful doom.
And those who believed and did good works are made to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein abiding by permission of their Lord, their greeting therein: Peace!
Seest thou not how Allah coineth a similitude: A goodly saying, as a goodly tree, its root set firm, its branches reaching into heaven,
Giving its fruit at every season by permission of its Lord ? Allah coineth the similitudes for mankind in order that they may reflect.
And the similitude of a bad saying is as a bad tree, uprooted from upon the earth, possessing no stability.
Allah confirmeth those who believe by a firm saying in the life of the world and in the Hereafter, and Allah sendeth wrong-doers astray. And Allah doeth what He will.
Hast thou not seen those who gave the grace of Allah in exchange for thanklessness and led their people down to the Abode of Loss,
(Even to) hell ? They are exposed thereto. A hapless end!
And they set up rivals to Allah that they may mislead (men) from His way. Say: Enjoy life (while ye may) for lo! your journeys end will be the Fire.
Tell My bondmen who believe to establish worship and spend of that which We have given them, secretly and publicly, before a day cometh wherein there will be neither traffick nor befriending.
Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth, and causeth water to descend from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you, and maketh the ships to be of service unto you, that they may run upon the sea at His command, and hath made of service unto you the rivers;
And maketh the sun and the moon, constant in their courses, to be of service unto you, and hath made of service unto you the night and the day.
And He giveth you of all ye ask of Him, and if ye would count the bounty of Allah ye cannot reckon it. Lo! man is verily a wrong-doer, an ingrate.
And when Abraham said: My Lord! Make safe this territory, and preserve me and my sons from serving idols.
My Lord! Lo! they have led many of mankind astray. But whoso followeth me, he verily is of me. And whoso disobeyeth me - Still Thou art Forgiving, Merciful.
Our Lord! Lo! I have settled some of my posterity in an uncultivable valley near unto Thy holy House, our Lord! that they may establish proper worship; so incline some hearts of men that they may yearn toward them, and provide Thou them with fruits in order that they may be thankful.
Our Lord! Lo! Thou knowest that which we hide and that which we proclaim. Nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah.
Praise be to Allah Who hath given me, in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac! Lo! my Lord is indeed the Hearer of Prayer.
My Lord! Make me to establish proper worship, and some of my posterity (also); our Lord! and accept my prayer.
Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents and believers on the day when the account is cast.
Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do. He but giveth them a respite till a day when eyes will stare (in terror),
As they come hurrying on in fear, their heads upraised, their gaze returning not to them, and their hearts as air.
And warn mankind of a day when the doom will come upon them, and those who did wrong will say: Our Lord! Reprieve us for a little while. We will obey Thy call and will follow the messengers. (It will be answered): Did ye not swear before that there would be no end for you ?
And (have ye not) dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves (of old) and (hath it not) become plain to you how We dealt with them and made examples for you ?
Verily they have plotted their plot, and their plot is with Allah, though their plot were one whereby the mountains should be moved.
So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His messengers. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong).
On the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth, and the heavens (also will be changed) and they will come forth unto Allah, the One, the Almighty,
Thou wilt see the guilty on that day linked together in chains,
Their raiment of pitch, and the Fire covering their faces,
That Allah may repay each soul what it hath earned. Lo! Allah is swift at reckoning.
This is a clear message for mankind in order that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is only One God, and that men of understanding may take heed.
Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture and a plain Reading.
It may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were Muslims.
Let them eat and enjoy life, and let (false) hope beguile them. They will come to know!
And We destroyed no township but there was a known decree for it.
No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind.
And they say: O thou unto whom the Reminder is revealed, lo! thou art indeed a madman!
Why bringest thou not angels unto us, if thou art of the truthful ?
We send not down the angels save with the Fact, and in that case (the disbelievers) would not be tolerated.
Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian.
We verily sent (messengers) before thee among the factions of the men of old.
And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him.
Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty:
They believe not therein, though the example of the men of old hath gone before.
And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting through it,
They would say: Our sight is wrong - nay, but we are folk bewitched.
And verily in the heaven we have set mansions of the stars, and We have beautified it for beholders.
And We have guarded it from every outcast devil,
Save him who stealeth the hearing, and them doth a clear flame pursue.
And the earth have We spread out, and placed therein firm hills, and caused each seemly thing to grow therein.
And we have given unto you livelihoods therein, and unto those for whom ye provide not.
And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof. And we send it not down save in appointed measure.
And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky, and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof.
Lo! and it is We, even We, Who quicken and give death, and We are the Inheritor.
And verily We know the eager among you and verily We know the laggards.
Lo! thy Lord will gather them together. Lo! He is Wise, Aware.
Verily We created man of potters clay of black mud altered,
And the jinn did We create aforetime of essential fire.
And (remember) when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am creating a mortal out of potters clay of black mud altered,
So, when I have made him and have breathed into him of My Spirit, do ye fall down, prostrating yourselves unto him.
So the angels fell prostrate, all of them together
Save Iblis. He refused to be among the prostrate.
He said: O Iblis! What aileth thee that thou art not among the prostrate ?
He said: I am not one to prostrate myself unto a mortal whom Thou hast created out of potters clay of black mud altered!
He said: Then go thou forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast.
And lo! the curse shall be upon thee till the Day of Judgment.
He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised.
He said: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved
Till the Day of appointed time.
He said: My Lord! Because Thou hast sent me astray, I verily shall adorn the path of error for them in the earth, and shall mislead them every one,
Save such of them as are Thy perfectly devoted slaves.
He said: This is a right course incumbent upon Me:
Lo! as for My slaves, thou hast no power over any of them save such of the froward as follow thee,
And lo! for all such, hell will be the promised place.
It hath seven gates, and each gate hath an appointed portion.
Lo! those who ward off (evil) are among gardens and watersprings.
(And it is said unto them): Enter them in peace, secure.
And We remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts. As brethren, face to face, (they rest) on couches raised.
Toil cometh not unto them there, nor will they be expelled from thence.
Announce, (O Muhammad) unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful,
And that My doom is the dolorous doom.
And tell them of Abrahams guests,
(How) when they came in unto him, and said: Peace. He said: Lo! we are afraid of you.
They said: Be not afraid! Lo! we bring thee good tidings of a boy possessing wisdom.
He said: Bring ye me good tidings (of a son) when old age hath overtaken me ? Of what then can ye bring good tidings ?
They said: We bring thee good tidings in truth. So be not thou of the despairing.
He said: And who despaireth of the mercy of his Lord save those who are astray ?
He said: And afterward what is your business, O ye messengers (of Allah) ?
They said: We have been sent unto a guilty folk,
(All) save the family of Lot. Them we shall deliver every one,
Except his wife, of whom We had decreed that she should be of those who stay behind.
And when the messengers came unto the family of Lot,
He said: Lo! ye are folk unknown (to me).
They said: Nay, but we bring thee that concerning which they keep disputing,
And bring thee the Truth, and lo! we are truth-tellers.
So travel with thy household in a portion of the night, and follow thou their backs. Let none of you turn round, but go whither ye are commanded.
And We made plain the case to him, that the root of them (who did wrong) was to be cut at early morn.
And the people of the city came, rejoicing at the news (of new arrivals).
He said: Lo! they are my guests. Affront me not!
And keep your duty to Allah, and shame me not!
They said; Have we not forbidden you from (entertaining) anyone ?
He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing (so).
By thy life (O Muhammad) they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching death.
Then the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the sunrise.
And We utterly confounded them, and We rained upon them stones of heated clay.
Lo! therein verily are portents for those who read the signs.
And lo! it is upon a road still uneffaced.
Lo! therein is indeed a portent for believers.
And the dwellers in the wood indeed were evil-doers.
So we took vengeance on them; and lo! they both are on a high-road plain to see.
And the dwellers in Al-Hijr denied (Our) messengers.
And we gave them Our revelations, but they were averse to them.
And they used to hew out dwellings from the hills, (wherein they dwelt) secure.
But the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the morning hour,
And that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not.
We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save with truth, and lo! the Hour is surely coming. So forgive, (O Muhammad), with a gracious forgiveness.
Lo! Thy Lord! He is the All-Wise Creator.
We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the great Quran.
Strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoin, and be not grieved on their account, and lower thy wing (in tenderness) for the believers.
And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner,
Such as We send down for those who make division,
Those who break the Quran into parts.
Them, by thy Lord, We shall question, every one,
Of what they used to do.
So proclaim that which thou art commanded, and withdraw from the idolaters.
Lo! We defend thee from the scoffers,
Who set some other god along with Allah. But they will come to know.
Well know We that thy bosom is oppressed by what they say,
But hymn the praise of thy Lord, and be of those who make prostration (unto Him).
And serve thy Lord till the Inevitable cometh unto thee.
The commandment of Allah will come to pass, so seek not ye to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate (with Him).
He sendeth down the angels with the Spirit of His command unto whom He will of His bondmen, (saying): Warn mankind that there is no God save Me, so keep your duty unto Me.
He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. High be He Exalted above all that they associate (with Him).
He hath created man from a drop of fluid, yet behold! he is an open opponent.
And the cattle hath He created, whence ye have warm clothing and uses, and whereof ye eat;
And wherein is beauty for you, when ye bring them home, and when ye take them out to pasture.
And they bear your loads for you unto a land ye could not reach save with great trouble to yourselves. Lo! your Lord is Full of Pity, Merciful.
And horses and mules and asses (hath He created) that ye may ride them, and for ornament. And He createth that which ye know not.
And Allahs is the direction of the way, and some (roads) go not straight. And had He willed He would have led you all aright.
He it is Who sendeth down water from the sky, whence ye have drink, and whence are trees on which ye send your beasts to pasture.
Therewith He causeth crops to grow for you, and the olive and the date-palm and grapes and all kinds of fruit. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for people who reflect.
And He hath constrained the night and the day and the sun and the moon to be of service unto you, and the stars are made subservient by His command. Lo! herein indeed are portents for people who have sense.
And whatsoever He hath created for you in the earth of divers hues, lo! therein is indeed a portent for people who take heed.
And He it is Who hath constrained the sea to be of service that ye eat fresh meat from thence, and bring forth from thence ornaments which ye wear. And thou seest the ships ploughing it that ye (mankind) may seek of His bounty and that haply ye may give thanks.
And He hath cast into the earth firm hills that it quake not with you, and streams and roads that ye may find a way.
And landmarks (too), and by the star they find a way.
Is He then Who createth as him who createth not ? Will ye not then remember ?
And if ye would count the favour of Allah ye cannot reckon it. Lo! Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful.
And Allah knoweth that which ye keep hidden and that which ye proclaim.
Those unto whom they cry beside Allah created naught, but are themselves created.
(They are) dead, not living. And they know not when they will be raised.
Your God is One God. But as for those who believe not in the Hereafter their hearts refuse to know, for they are proud.
Assuredly Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim. Lo! He loveth not the proud.
And when it is said unto them: What hath your Lord revealed ? they say: (Mere) fables of the men of old,
That they may bear their burdens undiminished on the Day of Resurrection, with somewhat of the burdens of those whom they mislead without knowledge. Ah! evil is that which they bear!
Those before them plotted, so Allah struck at the foundations of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them from above them, and the doom came on them whence they knew not;
Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and will say: Where are My partners, for whose sake ye opposed (My guidance) ? Those who have been given knowledge will say: Disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers,
Whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging themselves. Then will they make full submission (saying): We used not to do any wrong. Nay! Surely Allah is Knower of what ye used to do.
So enter the gates of hell, to dwell therein for ever. Woeful indeed will be the lodging of the arrogant.
And it is said unto those who ward off (evil): What hath your Lord revealed ? They say: Good. For those who do good in this world there is a good (reward) and the home of the Hereafter will be better. Pleasant indeed will be the home of those who ward off (evil) -
Gardens of Eden which they enter, underneath which rivers flow, wherein they have what they will. Thus Allah repayeth those who ward off (evil),
Those whom the angels cause to die (when they are) good. They say: Peace be unto you! Enter the Garden because of what ye used to do.
Await they aught say that the angels should come unto them or thy Lords command should come to pass ? Even so did those before them. Allah wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves,
So that the evils of what they did smote them, and that which they used to mock surrounded them.
And the idolaters say: Had Allah willed, we had not worshipped aught beside Him, we and our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught without (command from) Him. Even so did those before them. Are the messengers charged with aught save plain conveyance (of the message) ?
And verily We have raised in every nation a messenger, (proclaiming): Serve Allah and shun false gods. Then some of them (there were) whom Allah guided, and some of them (there were) upon whom error had just hold. Do but travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers!
Even if thou (O Muhammad) desirest their right guidance, still Allah assuredly will not guide him who misleadeth. Such have no helpers.
And they swear by Allah their most binding oaths (that) Allah will not raise up him who dieth. Nay, but it is a promise (binding) upon Him in truth, but most of mankind know not,
That He may explain unto them that wherein they differ, and that those who disbelieved may know that they were liars.
And Our word unto a thing, when We intend it, is only that We say unto it: Be! and it is.
And those who became fugitives for the cause of Allah after they had been oppressed, We verily shall give them goodly lodging in the world, and surely the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they but knew;
Such as are steadfast and put their trust in Allah.
And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men whom We inspired - Ask the followers of the Remembrance if ye know not! -
With clear proofs and writings; and We have revealed unto thee the Remembrance that thou mayst explain to mankind that which hath been revealed for them, and that haply they may reflect.
Are they who plan ill-deeds then secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them, or that the doom will not come on them whence they know not ?
Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro so that there be no escape for them ?
Or that He will not seize them with a gradual wasting ? Lo! thy Lord is indeed Full of Pity, Merciful.
Have they not observed all things that Allah hath created, how their shadows incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto Allah, and they are lowly ?
And unto Allah maketh prostration whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth of living creatures, and the angels (also) and they are not proud.
They fear their Lord above them, and do what they are bidden.
Allah hath said: Choose not two gods. There is only One God. So of Me, Me only, be in awe.
Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth, and religion is His for ever. Will ye then fear any other than Allah ?
And whatever of comfort ye enjoy, it is from Allah. Then, when misfortune reacheth you, unto Him ye cry for help.
And afterward, when He hath rid you of the misfortune, behold! a set of you attribute partners to their Lord,
So as to deny that which We have given them. Then enjoy life (while ye may), for ye will come to know.
And they assign a portion of that which We have given them unto what they know not. By Allah! but ye will indeed be asked concerning (all) that ye used to invent.
And they assign unto Allah daughters - Be He Glorified! - and unto themselves what they desire;
When if one of them receiveth tidings of the birth of a female, his face remaineth darkened, and he is wroth inwardly.
He hideth himself from the folk because of the evil of that whereof he hath had tidings, (asking himself): Shall he keep it in contempt, or bury it beneath the dust. Verily evil is their judgment.
For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil similitude, and Allahs is the Sublime Similitude. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
If Allah were to take mankind to task for their wrong-doing, he would not leave hereon a living creature, but He reprieveth them to an appointed term, and when their term cometh they cannot put (it) off an hour nor (yet) advance (it).
And they assign unto Allah that which they (themselves) dislike, and their tongues expound the lie that the better portion will be theirs. Assuredly theirs will be the Fire, and they will be abandoned.
By Allah, We verily sent messengers unto the nations before thee, but the devil made their deeds fairseeming unto them. So he is their patron this day, and theirs will be a painful doom.
And We have revealed the Scripture unto thee only that thou mayst explain unto them that wherein they differ, and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.
Allah sendeth down water from the sky and therewith reviveth the earth after her death. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a folk who hear.
And lo! in the cattle there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, from betwixt the refuse and the blood, pure milk palatable to the drinkers.
And of the fruits of the date-palm, and grapes, whence ye derive strong drink and (also) good nourishment. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for people who have sense.
And thy Lord inspired the bee, saying: Choose thou habitations in the hills and in the trees and in that which they thatch;
Then eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of thy Lord, made smooth (for thee). There cometh forth from their bellies a drink divers of hues, wherein is healing for mankind. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for people who reflect.
And Allah createth you, then causeth you to die, and among you is he who is brought back to the most abject stage of life, so that he knoweth nothing after (having had) knowledge. Lo! Allah is Knower, Powerful.
And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision. Now those who are more favoured will by no means hand over their provision to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof. Is it then the grace of Allah that they deny ?
And Allah hath given you wives of your own kind, and hath given you, from your wives, sons and grandsons, and hath made provision of good things for you. Is it then in vanity that they believe and in the grace of Allah that they disbelieve ?
And they worship beside Allah that which owneth no provision whatsoever for them from the heavens or the earth, nor have they (whom they worship) any power.
So coin not similitudes for Allah. Lo! Allah knoweth; ye know not.
Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave, who hath control of nothing, and (on the other hand) one on whom we have bestowed a fair provision from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly. Are they equal ? Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not.
And Allah coineth a similitude: Two men, one of them dumb, having control of nothing, and he is a burden on his owner; whithersoever he directeth him to go, he bringeth no good. Is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth a straight path (of conduct) ?
And unto Allah belongeth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, and the matter of the Hour (of Doom) is but as a twinkling of the eye, or it is nearer still. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.
And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers knowing nothing, and gave you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye might give thanks.
Have they not seen the birds obedient in mid-air ? None holdeth them save Allah. Lo! herein, verily, are portents for a people who believe.
And Allah hath given you in your houses an abode, and hath given you (also), of the hides of cattle, houses which ye find light (to carry) on the day of migration and on the day of pitching camp; and of their wool and their fur and their hair, caparison and comfort for a while.
And Allah hath given you, of that which He hath created, shelter from the sun; and hath given you places of refuge in the mountains, and hath given you coats to ward off the heat from you, and coats (of armour) to save you from your own foolhardiness. Thus doth He perfect His favour unto you, in order that ye may surrender (unto Him).
Then, if they turn away, thy duty (O Muhammad) is but plain conveyance (of the message).
They know the favour of Allah and then deny it. Most of them are ingrates.
And (bethink you of) the day when we raise up of every nation a witness, then there is no leave for disbelievers, nor are they allowed to make amends.
And when those who did wrong behold the doom, it will not be made light for them, nor will they be reprieved.
And when those who ascribed partners to Allah behold those partners of theirs, they will say: Our Lord! these are our partners unto whom we used to cry instead of Thee. But they will fling to them the saying: Lo! ye verily are liars!
And they proffer unto Allah submission on that day, and all that they used to invent hath failed them.
For those who disbelieve and debar (men) from the way of Allah, We add doom to doom because they wrought corruption,
And (bethink you of) the day when We raise in every nation a witness against them of their own folk, and We bring thee (Muhammad) as a witness against these. And We reveal the Scripture unto thee as an exposition of all things, and a guidance and a mercy and good tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah).
Lo! Allah enjoineth justice and kindness, and giving to kinsfolk, and forbiddeth lewdness and abomination and wickedness. He exhorteth you in order that ye may take heed.
Fulfil the covenant of Allah when ye have covenanted, and break not your oaths after the asseveration of them, and after ye have made Allah surety over you. Lo! Allah knoweth what ye do.
And be not like unto her who unravelleth the thread, after she hath made it strong, to thin filaments, making your oaths a deceit between you because of a nation being more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only trieth you thereby, and He verily will explain to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein ye differed.
Had Allah willed He could have made you (all) one nation, but He sendeth whom He will astray and guideth whom He will, and ye will indeed be asked of what ye used to do.
Make not your oaths a deceit between you, lest a foot should slip after being firmly planted and ye should taste evil forasmuch as ye debarred (men) from the way of Allah, and yours should be an awful doom.
And purchase not a small gain at the price of Allahs covenant. Lo! that which Allah hath is better for you, if ye did but know.
That which ye have wasteth away, and that which Allah hath remaineth. And verily We shall pay those who are steadfast a recompense in proportion to the best of what they used to do.
Whosoever doeth right, whether male or female, and is a believer, him verily we shall quicken with good life, and We shall pay them a recompense in proportion to the best of what they used to do.
And when thou recitest the Quran, seek refuge in Allah from Satan the outcast.
Lo! he hath no power over those who believe and put trust in their Lord.
His power is only over those who make a friend of him, and those who ascribe partners unto Him (Allah).
And when We put a revelation in place of (another) revelation, - and Allah knoweth best what He revealeth - they say: Lo! thou art but inventing. Most of them know not.
Say: The holy Spirit hath delivered it from thy Lord with truth, that it may confirm (the faith of) those who believe, and as guidance and good tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah).
And We know well that they say: Only a man teacheth him. The speech of him at whom they falsely hint is outlandish, and this is clear Arabic speech.
Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, Allah guideth them not and theirs will be a painful doom.
Only they invent falsehood who believe not Allahs revelations, and (only) they are the liars.
Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief - save him who is forced thereto and whose heart is still content with the Faith - but whoso findeth ease in disbelief: On them is wrath from Allah. Theirs will be an awful doom.
That is because they have chosen the life of the world rather than the Hereafter, and because Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.
Such are they whose hearts and ears and eyes Allah hath sealed. And such are the heedless.
Assuredly in the Hereafter they are the losers.
Then lo! thy Lord - for those who became fugitives after they had been persecuted, and then fought and were steadfast - lo! thy Lord afterward is (for them) indeed Forgiving, Merciful.
On the Day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be repaid what it did, and they will not be wronged.
Allah coineth a similitude: a township that dwelt secure and well content, its provision coming to it in abundance from every side, but it disbelieved in Allahs favours, so Allah made it experience the garb of dearth and fear because of what they used to do.
And verily there had come unto them a messenger from among them, but they had denied him, and so the torment seized them while they were wrong-doers.
So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah hath provided for you, and thank the bounty of your Lord if it is Him ye serve.
He hath forbidden for you only carrion and blood and swineflesh and that which hath been immolated in the name of any other than Allah; but he who is driven thereto, neither craving nor transgressing, lo! then Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
And speak not, concerning that which your own tongues qualify (as clean or unclean), the falsehood: This is lawful, and this is forbidden, so that ye invent a lie against Allah. Lo! those who invent a lie against Allah will not succeed.
A brief enjoyment (will be theirs); and theirs a painful doom.
And unto those who are Jews We have forbidden that which We have already related unto thee. And We wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong themselves.
Then lo! thy Lord - for those who do evil in ignorance and afterward repent and amend - lo! (for them) thy Lord is afterward indeed Forgiving, Merciful.
Lo! Abraham was a nation obedient to Allah, by nature upright, and he was not of the idolaters;
Thankful for His bounties; He chose him and He guided him unto a straight path.
And We gave him good in the world, and in the Hereafter he is among the righteous.
And afterward We inspired thee (Muhammad, saying): Follow the religion of Abraham, as one by nature upright. He was not of the idolaters.
The Sabbath was appointed only for those who differed concerning it, and lo! thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ.
Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation, and reason with them in the better way. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is Best Aware of those who go aright.
If ye punish, then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted. But if ye endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient.
Endure thou patiently (O Muhammad). Thine endurance is only by (the help of) Allah. Grieve not for them, and be not in distress because of that which they devise.
Lo! Allah is with those who keep their duty unto Him and those who are doers of good.
Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from the Inviolable Place of Worship to the Far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, that We might show him of Our tokens! Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Seer.
We gave unto Moses the Scripture, and We appointed it a guidance for the children of Israel, saying: Choose no guardian beside Me.
(They were) the seed of those whom We carried (in the ship) along with Noah. Lo! he was a grateful slave.
And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture: Ye verily will work corruption in the earth twice, and ye will become great tyrants.
So when the time for the first of the two came, We roused against you slaves of Ours of great might who ravaged (your) country, and it was a threat performed.
Then we gave you once again your turn against them, and We aided you with wealth and children and made you more in soldiery.
(Saying): If ye do good, ye do good for your own souls, and if ye do evil, it is for them (in like manner). So, when the time for the second (of the judgments) came (We roused against you others of Our slaves) to ravage you, and to enter the Temple even as they entered it the first time, and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting.
It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you, but if ye repeat (the crime) We shall repeat (the punishment), and We have appointed hell a dungeon for the disbelievers.
Lo! this Quran guideth unto that which is straightest, and giveth tidings unto the believers who do good works that theirs will be a great reward.
And that those who believe not in the Hereafter, for them We have prepared a painful doom.
Man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good; for man was ever hasty.
And We appoint the night and the day two portents. Then We make dark the portent of the night, and We make the portent of the day sight-giving, that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the computation of the years, and the reckoning; and everything have We expounded with a clear expounding.
And every mans augury have We fastened to his own neck, and We shall bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open.
(And it will be said unto him): Read thy Book. Thy soul sufficeth as reckoner against thee this day.
Whosoever goeth right, it is only for (the good of) his own soul that he goeth right, and whosoever erreth, erreth only to its hurt. No laden soul can bear anothers load, We never punish until we have sent a messenger.
And when We would destroy a township We send commandment to its folk who live at ease, and afterward they commit abomination therein, and so the Word (of doom) hath effect for it, and we annihilate it with complete annihilation.
How many generations have We destroyed since Noah! And Allah sufficeth as Knower and Beholder of the sins of His slaves.
Whoso desireth that (life) which hasteneth away, We hasten for him therein what We will for whom We please. And afterward We have appointed for him hell; he will endure the heat thereof, condemned, rejected.
And whoso desireth the Hereafter and striveth for it with the effort necessary, being a believer; for such, their effort findeth favour (with their Lord).
Each do We supply, both these and those, from the bounty of thy Lord. And the bounty of thy Lord can never be walled up.
See how We prefer one of them above another, and verily the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment.
Set not up with Allah any other god (O man) lest thou sit down reproved, forsaken.
Thy Lord hath decreed, that ye worship none save Him, and (that ye show) kindness to parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age with thee, say not Fie unto them nor repulse them, but speak unto them a gracious word.
And lower unto them the wing of submission through mercy, and say: My Lord! Have mercy on them both as they did care for me when I was little.
Your Lord is Best Aware of what is in your minds. If ye are righteous, then lo! He was ever Forgiving unto those who turn (unto Him).
Give the kinsman his due, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and squander not (thy wealth) in wantonness.
Lo! the squanderers were ever brothers of the devils, and the devil was ever an ingrate to his Lord.
But if thou turn away from them, seeking mercy from thy Lord, for which thou hopest, then speak unto them a reasonable word.
And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with a complete opening, lest thou sit down rebuked, denuded.
Lo! thy Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo, He was ever Knower, Seer of His slaves.
Slay not your children, fearing a fall to poverty, We shall provide for them and for you. Lo! the slaying of them is great sin.
And come not near unto adultery. Lo! it is an abomination and an evil way.
And slay not the life which Allah hath forbidden save with right. Whoso is slain wrongfully, We have given power unto his heir, but let him not commit excess in slaying. Lo! he will be helped.
Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he come to strength; and keep the covenant. Lo! of the covenant it will be asked.
Fill the measure when ye measure, and weigh with a right balance; that is meet, and better in the end.
(O man), follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge. Lo! the hearing and the sight and the heart - of each of these it will be asked.
And walk not in the earth exultant. Lo! thou canst not rend the earth, nor canst thou stretch to the height of the hills.
The evil of all that is hateful in the sight of thy Lord.
This is (part) of that wisdom wherewith thy Lord hath inspired thee (O Muhammad). And set not up with Allah any other god, lest thou be cast into hell, reproved, abandoned.
Hath your Lord then distinguished you (O men of Makka) by giving you sons, and hath chosen for Himself females from among the angels ? Lo! verily ye speak an awful word!
We verily have displayed (Our warnings) in this Quran that they may take heed, but it increaseth them in naught save aversion.
Say (O Muhammad, to the disbelievers): If there were other gods along with Him, as they say, then had they sought a way against the Lord of the Throne.
Glorified is He, and High Exalted above what they say!
The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein praise Him, and there is not a thing but hymneth His praise; but ye understand not their praise. Lo! He is ever Clement, Forgiving.
And when thou recitest the Quran we place between thee and those who believe not in the Hereafter a hidden barrier;
And We place upon their hearts veils lest they should understand it, and in their ears a deafness; and when thou makest mention of thy Lord alone in the Quran, they turn their backs in aversion.
We are Best Aware of what they wish to hear when they give ear to thee and when they take secret counsel, when the evil-doers say: Ye follow but a man bewitched.
See what similitudes they coin for thee, and thus are all astray, and cannot find a road!
And they say: When we are bones and fragments, shall we forsooth, be raised up as a new creation ?
Say: Be ye stones or iron
Or some created thing that is yet greater in your thoughts! Then they will say: Who shall bring us back (to life). Say: He Who created you at the first. Then will they shake their heads at thee, and say: When will it be ? Say: It will perhaps be soon;
A day when He will call you and ye will answer with His praise, and ye will think that ye have tarried but a little while.
Tell My bondmen to speak that which is kindlier. Lo! the devil soweth discord among them. Lo! the devil is for man an open foe.
Your Lord is Best Aware of you. If He will, He will have mercy on you, or if He will, He will punish you. We have not sent thee (O Muhammad) as a warden over them.
And thy Lord is Best Aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth. And we preferred some of the prophets above others, and unto David We gave the Psalms.
Say: Cry unto those (saints and angels) whom ye assume (to be gods) beside Him, yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to change.
Those unto whom they cry seek the way of approach to their Lord, which of them shall be the nearest; they hope for His mercy and they fear His doom. Lo! the doom of thy Lord is to be shunned.
There is not a township but We shall destroy it ere the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with dire punishment. That is set forth in the Book (of Our decrees).
Naught hindereth Us from sending portents save that the folk of old denied them. And We gave Thamud the she-camel - a clear portent save to warn.
And (it was a warning) when we told thee: Lo! thy Lord encompasseth mankind, and We appointed the sight which We showed thee as an ordeal for mankind, and (likewise) the Accursed Tree in the Quran. We warn them, but it increaseth them in naught save gross impiety.
And when We said unto the angels: Fall down prostrate before Adam and they fell prostrate all save Iblis, he said: Shall I fall prostrate before that which Thou hast created of clay ?
He said: Seest Thou this (creature) whom Thou hast honoured above me, if Thou give me grace until the Day of Resurrection I verily will seize his seed, save but a few.
He said: Go, and whosoever of them followeth thee - lo! hell will be your payment, ample payment.
And excite any of them whom thou canst with thy voice, and urge thy horse and foot against them, and be a partner in their wealth and children, and promise them. Satan promiseth them only to deceive.
Lo! My (faithful) bondmen - over them thou hast no power, and thy Lord sufficeth as (their) guardian.
(O mankind), your Lord is He Who driveth for you the ship upon the sea that ye may seek of His bounty. Lo! He was ever Merciful toward you.
And when harm toucheth you upon the sea, all unto whom ye cry (for succour) fail save Him (alone), but when He bringeth you safe to land, ye turn away, for man was ever thankless.
Feel ye then secure that He will not cause a slope of the land to engulf you, or send a sand-storm upon you, and then ye will find that ye have no protector ?
Or feel ye secure that He will not return you to that (plight) a second time, and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your thanklessness, and then ye will not find therein that ye have any avenger against Us ?
Verily we have honoured the Children of Adam. We carry them on the land and the sea, and have made provision of good things for them, and have preferred them above many of those whom We created with a marked preferment.
On the day when We shall summon all men with their record, whoso is given his book in his right hand - such will read their book and they will not be wronged a shred.
Whoso is blind here will be blind in the Hereafter, and yet further from the road.
And they indeed strove hard to beguile thee (Muhammad) away from that wherewith We have inspired thee, that thou shouldst invent other than it against Us; and then would they have accepted thee as a friend.
And if We had not made thee wholly firm thou mightest almost have inclined unto them a little.
Then had we made thee taste a double (punishment) of living and a double (punishment) of dying, then hadst thou found no helper against Us.
And they indeed wished to scare thee from the land that they might drive thee forth from thence, and then they would have stayed (there) but a little after thee.
(Such was Our) method in the case of those whom We sent before thee (to mankind), and thou wilt not find for Our method aught of power to change.
Establish worship at the going down of the sun until the dark of night, and (the recital of) the Quran at dawn. Lo! (the recital of) the Quran at dawn is ever witnessed.
And some part of the night awake for it, a largess for thee. It may be that thy Lord will raise thee to a praised estate.
And say: My Lord! Cause me to come in with a firm incoming and to go out with a firm outgoing. And give me from Thy presence a sustaining Power.
And say: Truth hath come and falsehood hath vanished away. Lo! falsehood is ever bound to vanish.
And We reveal of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy for believers though it increase the evil-doers in naught save ruin.
And when We make life pleasant unto man, he turneth away and is averse; and when ill toucheth him he is in despair.
Say: Each one doth according to his rule of conduct, and thy Lord is Best Aware of him whose way is right.
They are asking thee concerning the Spirit. Say: The Spirit is by command of my Lord, and of knowledge ye have been vouchsafed but little.
And if We willed We could withdraw that which We have revealed unto thee, then wouldst thou find no guardian for thee against Us in respect thereof.
(It is naught) save mercy from thy Lord. Lo! His kindness unto thee was ever great.
Say: Verily, though mankind and the jinn should assemble to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof though they were helpers one of another.
And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Quran all kind of similitudes, but most of mankind refuse aught save disbelief.
And they say: We will not put faith in thee till thou cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us;
Or thou have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth therein abundantly;
Or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us piecemeal, as thou hast pretended, or bring Allah and the angels as a warrant;
Or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend up into heaven, and even then we will put no faith in thine ascension till thou bring down for us a book that we can read. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord be Glorified! Am I aught save a mortal messenger ?
And naught prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came unto them save that they said: Hath Allah sent a mortal as (His) messenger ?
Say: If there were in the earth angels walking secure, We had sent down for them from heaven an angel as messenger.
Say: Allah sufficeth for a witness between me and you. Lo! He is Knower, Seer of His slaves.
And he whom Allah guideth, he is led aright; while, as for him whom He sendeth astray, for them thou wilt find no protecting friends beside Him, and We shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their habitation will be hell; whenever it abateth, We increase the flame for them.
That is their reward because they disbelieved Our revelations and said: When we are bones and fragments shall we, forsooth, be raised up as a new creation ?
Have they not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is Able to create the like of them, and hath appointed for them an end whereof there is no doubt ? But the wrong-doers refuse aught save disbelief.
Say (unto them): If ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, ye would surely hold them back for fear of spending, for man was ever grudging.
And verily We gave unto Moses nine tokens, clear proofs (of Allahs Sovereignty). Do but ask the Children of Israel how he came unto them, then Pharaoh said unto him: Lo! I deem thee one bewitched, O Moses.
He said: In truth thou knowest that none sent down these (portents) save the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs, and lo! (for my part) I deem thee lost, O Pharaoh.
And he wished to scare them from the land, but We drowned him and those with him, all together.
And We said unto the Children of Israel after him: Dwell in the land; but when the promise of the Hereafter cometh to pass We shall bring you as a crowd gathered out of various nations.
With truth have We sent it down, and with truth hath it descended. And We have sent thee as naught else save a bearer of good tidings and a warner.
And (it is) a Quran that We have divided, that thou mayst recite it unto mankind at intervals, and We have revealed it by (successive) revelation.
Say: Believe therein or believe not, lo! those who were given knowledge before it, when it is read unto them, fall down prostrate on their faces, adoring,
Saying: Glory to our Lord! Verily the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled.
They fall down on their faces, weeping, and it increaseth humility in them.
Say (unto mankind): Cry unto Allah, or cry unto the Beneficent, unto whichsoever ye cry (it is the same). His are the most beautiful names. And thou (Muhammad), be not loud-voiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein, but follow a way between.
And say: Praise be to Allah, Who hath not taken unto Himself a son, and Who hath no partner in the Sovereignty, nor hath He any protecting friend through dependence. And magnify Him with all magnificence.
Praise be to Allah Who hath revealed the Scripture unto His slave, and hath not placed therein any crookedness,
(But hath made it) straight, to give warning of stern punishment from Him, and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be a fair reward,
Wherein they will abide for ever;
And to warn those who say: Allah hath chosen a son,
(A thing) whereof they have no knowledge, nor (had) their fathers, Dreadful is the word that cometh out of their mouths. They speak naught but a lie.
Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement, that thou (Muhammad) wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps.
Lo! We have placed all that is on the earth as an ornament thereof that We may try them: which of them is best in conduct.
And lo! We shall make all that is thereon a barren mound.
Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription are a wonder among Our portents ?
When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave and said: Our Lord! Give us mercy from Thy presence, and shape for us right conduct in our plight.
Then We sealed up their hearing in the Cave for a number of years.
And afterward We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties would best calculate the time that they had tarried.
We narrate unto thee their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.
And We made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto no God beside Him, for then should we utter an enormity.
These, our people, have chosen (other) gods beside Him though they bring no clear warrant (vouchsafed) to them. And who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah ?
And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will prepare for you a pillow in your plight.
And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft thereof. That was (one) of the portents of Allah. He whom Allah guideth, he indeed is led aright, and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend.
And thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep, and We caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out his paws on the threshold. If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them.
And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another. A speaker from among them said: How long have ye tarried ? They said: We have tarried a day or some part of a day, (Others) said: Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city, and let him see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous and let no man know of you.
For they, if they should come to know of you, will stone you or turn you back to their religion; then ye will never prosper.
And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of worship over them.
(Some) will say: They were three, their dog the fourth, and (some) say: Five, their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and (some) say: Seven, and their dog the eighth. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord is Best Aware of their number. None knoweth them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending, and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them.
And say not of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow,
Except if Allah will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say: It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this.
And (it is said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine.
Say: Allah is Best Aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth. How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have no protecting friend beside Him, and He maketh none to share in His government.
And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him.
Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and evening, seeking His Countenance; and let not thine eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been abandoned.
Say: (It is) the truth from the Lord of you (all). Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers Fire. Its tent encloseth them. If they ask for showers, they will be showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces. Calamitous the drink and ill the resting-place!
Lo! as for those who believe and do good works - Lo! We suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost.
As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath them; therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon throne therein. Blest the reward, and fair the resting-place!
Coin for them a similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put between them tillage.
Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gush forth therein.
And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him: I am more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men.
And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself. He said: I think not that all this will ever perish.
I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort.
His comrade, when he (thus) spake with him, exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop (of seed), and then fashioned thee a man ?
But He is Allah, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner.
If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which Allah willeth (will come to pass)! There is no strength save in Allah! Though thou seest me as less than thee in wealth and children,
Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will send on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside,
Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst not make search for it.
And his fruit was beset (with destruction). Then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent upon it, when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to say: Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord!
And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah, nor could he save himself.
In this case is protection only from Allah, the True, He is Best for reward, and best for consequence.
And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. Allah is able to do all things.
Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world. But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lords sight for reward, and better in respect of hope.
And (bethink you of) the Day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth emerging, and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind.
And they are set before thy Lord in ranks (and it is said unto them): Now verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first. But ye thought that We had set no tryst for you.
And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is therein, and they say: What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a great thing but hath counted it! And they find all that they did confronting them, and thy Lord wrongeth no-one.
And (remember) when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his Lords command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead of Me, when they are an enemy unto you ? Calamitous is the exchange for evil-doers.
I made them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation; nor choose I misleaders for (My) helpers.
And (be mindful of) the Day when He will say: Call those partners of Mine whom ye pretended. Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their prayer, and We shall set a gulf of doom between them.
And the guilty behold the Fire and know that they are about to fall therein, and they find no way of escape thence.
And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Quran all manner of similitudes, but man is more than anything contentious.
And naught hindereth mankind from believing when the guidance cometh unto them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord unless (it be that they wish) that the judgment of the men of old should come upon them or (that) they should be confronted with the Doom.
We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners. Those who disbelieve contend with falsehood in order to refute the Truth thereby. And they take Our revelations and that wherewith they are threatened as a jest.
And who doth greater wrong than he who hath been reminded of the revelations of his Lord, yet turneth away from them and forgetteth what his hands send forward (to the Judgment) ? Lo! on their hearts We have placed coverings so that they understand not, and in their ears a deafness. And though thou call them to the guidance, in that case they can never be led aright.
Thy Lord is the Forgiver, Full of Mercy. If He took them to task (now) for what they earn, He would hasten on the doom for them; but theirs is an appointed term from which they will find no escape.
And (all) those townships! We destroyed them when they did wrong, and We appointed a fixed time for their destruction.
And when Moses said unto his servant: I will not give up until I reach the point where the two rivers meet, though I march on for ages.
And when they reached the point where the two met, they forgot their fish, and it took its way into the waters, being free.
And when they had gone further, he said unto his servant: Bring us our breakfast. Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey.
He said: Didst thou see, when we took refuge on the rock, and I forgot the fish - and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it - it took its way into the waters by a marvel.
He said: This is that which we have been seeking. So they retraced their steps again.
Then found they one of Our slaves, unto whom We had given mercy from Us, and had taught him knowledge from Our presence.
Moses said unto him: May I follow thee, to the end that thou mayst teach me right conduct of that which thou hast been taught ?
He said: Lo! thou canst not bear with me.
How canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any knowledge ?
He said: Allah willing, thou shalt find me patient and I shall not in aught gainsay thee.
He said: Well, if thou go with me, ask me not concerning aught till I myself make mention of it unto thee.
So they twain set out till, when they were in the ship, he made a hole therein. (Moses) said: Hast thou made a hole therein to drown the folk thereof ? Thou verily hast done a dreadful thing.
He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me ?
(Moses) said: Be not wroth with me that I forgot, and be not hard upon me for my fault.
So they twain journeyed on till, when they met a lad, he slew him. (Moses) said: What! Hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man ? Verily thou hast done a horrid thing.
He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me ?
(Moses) said: If I ask thee after this concerning aught, keep not company with me. Thou hast received an excuse from me.
So they twain journeyed on till, when they came unto the folk of a certain township, they asked its folk for food, but they refused to make them guests. And they found therein a wall upon the point of falling into ruin, and he repaired it. (Moses) said: If thou hadst wished, thou couldst have taken payment for it.
He said: This is the parting between thee and me! I will announce unto thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience.
As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working on the river, and I wished to mar it, for there was a king behind them who is taking every ship by force.
And as for the lad, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should oppress them by rebellion and disbelief.
And we intended that their Lord should change him for them for one better in purity and nearer to mercy.
And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and their father had been righteous, and thy Lord intended that they should come to their full strength and should bring forth their treasure as a mercy from their Lord; and I did it not upon my own command. Such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear.
They will ask thee of Dhul-Qarneyn. Say: I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him.
Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave him unto every thing a road.
And he followed a road
Till, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and found a people thereabout. We said: O Dhul-Qarneyn! Either punish or show them kindness.
He said: As for him who doeth wrong, we shall punish him, and then he will be brought back unto his Lord, Who will punish him with awful punishment!
But as for him who believeth and doeth right, good will be his reward, and We shall speak unto him a mild command.
Then he followed a road
Till, when he reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had appointed no shelter therefrom.
So (it was). And We knew all concerning him.
Then he followed a road
Till, when he came between the two mountains, he found upon their hither side a folk that scarce could understand a saying.
They said: O Dhul-Qarneyn! Lo! Gog and Magog are spoiling the land. So may we pay thee tribute on condition that thou set a barrier between us and them ?
He said: That wherein my Lord hath established me is better (than your tribute). Do but help me with strength (of men), I will set between you and them a bank.
Give me pieces of iron - till, when he had levelled up (the gap) between the cliffs, he said: Blow! - till, when he had made it a fire, he said: Bring me molten copper to pour thereon.
And (Gog and Magog) were not able to surmount, nor could they pierce (it).
He said: This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord cometh to pass, He will lay it low, for the promise of my Lord is true.
And on that day we shall let some of them surge against others, and the Trumpet will be blown. Then We shall gather them together in one gathering.
On that day we shall present hell to the disbelievers, plain to view,
Those whose eyes were hoodwinked from My reminder, and who could not bear to hear.
Do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose My bondmen as protecting friends beside Me ? Lo! We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers.
Say: Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works ?
Those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world, and yet they reckon that they do good work.
Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord and in the meeting with Him. Therefor their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection We assign no weight to them.
That is their reward: hell, because they disbelieved, and made a jest of Our revelations and Our messengers.
Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs are the Gardens of Paradise for welcome,
Wherein they will abide, with no desire to be removed from thence.
Say: Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord, verily the sea would be used up before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even though We brought the like thereof to help.
Say: I am only a mortal like you. My Lord inspireth in me that your God is only One God. And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work, and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord.
Kaf. Ha. Ya. Ain. Sad.
A mention of the mercy of thy Lord unto His servant Zachariah.
When he cried unto his Lord a cry in secret,
Saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord.
Lo! I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren. Oh, give me from Thy presence a successor
Who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee).
(It was said unto him): O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son whose name is John; we have given the same name to none before (him).
He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached infirm old age ?
He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me, even as I created thee before, when thou wast naught.
He said: My Lord! Appoint for me some token. He said: Thy token is that thou, with no bodily defect, shalt not speak unto mankind three nights.
Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, and signified to them: Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night.
(And it was said unto his son): O John! Hold fast the Scripture. And we gave him wisdom when a child,
And compassion from Our presence, and purity; and he was devout,
And dutiful toward his parents. And he was not arrogant, rebellious.
Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dieth and the day he shall be raised alive!
And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East,
And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man.
She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God-fearing.
He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son.
She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither have I been unchaste ?
He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing ordained.
And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place.
And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten!
Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee,
And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee.
So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal.
Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary! Thou hast come with an amazing thing.
O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot.
Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is in the cradle, a young boy ?
He spake: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet,
And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive,
And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest.
Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!
Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt.
It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is.
And lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So serve Him. That is the right path.
The sects among them differ: but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of an awful Day.
See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us! yet the evil-doers are to-day in error manifest.
And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided. Now they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not.
Lo! We, only We, inherit the earth and all who are thereon, and unto Us they are returned.
And make mention (O Muhammad) in the Scripture of Abraham. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet.
When he said unto his father: O my father! Why worshippest thou that which heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee ?
O my father! Lo! there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came not unto thee. So follow me, and I will lead thee on a right path.
O my father! Serve not the devil. Lo! the devil is a rebel unto the Beneficent.
O my father! Lo! I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee so that thou become a comrade of the devil.
He said: Rejectest thou my gods, O Abraham ? If thou cease not, I shall surely stone thee. Depart from me a long while!
He said: Peace be unto thee! I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee. Lo! He was ever gracious unto me.
I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside Allah, and I shall pray unto my Lord. It may be that, in prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be unblest.
So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were worshipping beside Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a prophet.
And we gave them of Our mercy, and assigned to them a high and true renown.
And make mention in the Scripture of Moses. Lo! he was chosen, and he was a messenger (of Allah), a prophet.
We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in communion.
And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet (likewise).
And make mention in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his promise, and he was a messenger (of Allah), a prophet.
He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was acceptable in the sight of his Lord.
And make mention in the Scripture of Idris. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet;
And We raised him to high station.
These are they unto whom Allah showed favour from among the prophets, of the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down, adoring and weeping.
Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined worship and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception.
Save him who shall repent and believe and do right. Such will enter the Garden, and they will not be wronged in aught -
Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent hath promised to His slaves in the unseen. Lo! His promise is ever sure of fulfilment -
They hear therein no idle talk, but only Peace; and therein they have food for morn and evening.
Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to inherit.
We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those two, and thy Lord was never forgetful -
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them! Therefor, worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service. Knowest thou one that can be named along with Him ?
And man saith: When I am dead, shall I forsooth be brought forth alive ?
Doth not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught ?
And, by thy Lord, verily We shall assemble them and the devils, then We shall bring them, crouching, around hell.
Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most stubborn in rebellion to the Beneficent.
And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein.
There is not one of you but shall approach it. That is a fixed ordinance of thy Lord.
Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil-doers crouching there.
And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Which of the two parties (yours or ours) is better in position, and more imposing as an army ?
How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were more imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming!
Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will verily prolong his span of life until, when they behold that which they were promised, whether it be punishment (in the world), or the Hour (of doom), they will know who is worse in position and who is weaker as an army.
Allah increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright, and the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lords sight for reward, and better for resort.
Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly I shall be given wealth and children ?
Hath he perused the Unseen, or hath he made a pact with the Beneficent ?
Nay, but We shall record that which he saith and prolong for him a span of torment.
And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake, and he will come unto Us, alone (without his wealth and children).
And they have chosen (other) gods beside Allah that they may be a power for them.
Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto them.
Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion ?
So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto them a sum (of days).
On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly company.
And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd,
They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a covenant with his Lord.
And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son.
Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing
Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins,
That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son,
When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should choose a son.
There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave.
Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering.
And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone.
Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for them love.
And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn therewith the froward folk.
And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound ?
Ta. Ha.
We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Quran that thou shouldst be distressed,
But as a reminder unto him who feareth,
A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens,
The Beneficent One, Who is established on the Throne.
Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is beneath the sod.
And if thou speakest aloud, then lo! He knoweth the secret (thought) and (that which is yet) more hidden.
Allah! There is no God save Him. His are the most beautiful names.
Hath there come unto thee the story of Moses ?
When he saw a fire and said unto his folk: Lo! Wait! I see a fire afar off. Peradventure I may bring you a brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire.
And when he reached it, he was called by name: O Moses!
Lo! I, even I, am thy Lord, So take off thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the holy valley of Tuwa.
And I have chosen thee, so hearken unto that which is inspired.
Lo! I, even I, am Allah, There is no God save Me. So serve Me and establish worship for My remembrance.
Lo! the Hour is surely coming. But I will to keep it hidden, that every soul may be rewarded for that which it striveth (to achieve).
Therefor, let not him turn thee aside from (the thought of) it who believeth not therein but followeth his own desire, lest thou perish.
And what is that in thy right hand, O Moses ?
He said: This is my staff whereon I lean, and wherewith I bear down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses.
He said: Cast it down, O Moses!
So he cast it down, and lo! it was a serpent, gliding.
He said: Grasp it and fear not. We shall return it to its former state.
And thrust thy hand within thine armpit, it will come forth white without hurt. (That will be) another token.
That We may show thee (some) of Our greater portents,
Go thou unto Pharaoh! Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds).
(Moses) said: My Lord! relieve my mind
And ease my task for me;
And loose a knot from my tongue,
That they may understand my saying.
Appoint for me a henchman from my folk,
Aaron, my brother.
Confirm my strength with him
And let him share my task,
That we may glorify Thee much
And much remember Thee.
Lo! Thou art ever Seeing us.
He said: Thou art granted thy request, O Moses.
And indeed, another time, already We have shown thee favour,
When we inspired in thy mother that which is inspired,
Saying: Throw him into the ark, and throw it into the river, then the river shall throw it on to the bank, and there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him shall take him. And I endued thee with love from Me that thou mightest be trained according to My will,
When thy sister went and said: Shall I show you one who will nurse him ? and we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not sorrow. And thou didst kill a man and We delivered thee from great distress, and tried thee with a heavy trial. And thou didst tarry years among the folk of Midian. Then camest thou (hither) by (My) providence, O Moses,
And I have attached thee to Myself.
Go, thou and thy brother, with My tokens, and be not faint in remembrance of Me.
Go, both of you, unto Pharaoh. Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds).
And speak unto him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear.
They said: Our Lord! Lo! we fear that he may be beforehand with us or that he may play the tyrant.
He said: Fear not. Lo! I am with you twain, Hearing and Seeing.
So go ye unto him and say: Lo! we are two messengers of thy Lord. So let the children of Israel go with us, and torment them not. We bring thee a token from thy Lord. And peace will be for him who followeth right guidance.
Lo! it hath been revealed unto us that the doom will be for him who denieth and turneth away.
(Pharaoh) said: Who then is the Lord of you twain, O Moses ?
He said: Our Lord is He Who gave unto everything its nature, then guided it aright.
He said: What then is the state of the generations of old ?
He said: The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord neither erreth nor forgetteth,
Who hath appointed the earth as a bed and hath threaded roads for you therein and hath sent down water from the sky and thereby We have brought forth divers kinds of vegetation,
(Saying): Eat ye and feed your cattle. Lo! herein verily are portents for men of thought.
Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return you, and thence We bring you forth a second time.
And We verily did show him all Our tokens, but he denied them and refused.
He said: Hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic, O Moses ?
But we surely can produce for thee magic the like thereof; so appoint a tryst between us and you, which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a place convenient (to us both).
(Moses) said: Your tryst shall be the day of the feast, and let the people assemble when the sun hath risen high.
Then Pharaoh went and gathered his strength, then came (to the appointed tryst).
Moses said unto them: Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He extirpate you by some punishment. He who lieth faileth miserably.
Then they debated one with another what they must do, and they kept their counsel secret.
They said: Lo! these are two wizards who would drive you out from your country by their magic, and destroy your best traditions;
So arrange your plan, and come in battle line. Whoso is uppermost this day will be indeed successful.
They said: O Moses! Either throw first, or let us be the first to throw ?
He said: Nay, do ye throw! Then lo! their cords and their staves, by their magic, appeared to him as though they ran.
And Moses conceived a fear in his mind.
We said: Fear not! Lo! thou art the higher.
Throw that which is in thy right hand! It will eat up that which they have made. Lo! that which they have made is but a wizards artifice, and a wizard shall not be successful to whatever point (of skill) he may attain.
Then the wizards were (all) flung down prostrate, crying: We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.
(Pharaoh) said: Ye put faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he is your chief who taught you magic. Now surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and I shall crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and ye shall know for certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment.
They said: We choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto us, and above Him Who created us. So decree what thou wilt decree. Thou wilt end for us only this life of the world.
Lo! we believe in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins and the magic unto which thou didst force us. Allah is better and more lasting.
Lo! whoso cometh guilty unto his Lord, verily for him is hell. There he will neither die nor live.
But whoso cometh unto Him a believer, having done good works, for such are the high stations;
Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the reward of him who groweth.
And verily We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night and strike for them a dry path in the sea, fearing not to be overtaken, neither being afraid (of the sea).
Then Pharaoh followed them with his hosts and there covered them that which did cover them of the sea.
And Pharaoh led his folk astray, he did not guide them.
O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and we made a covenant with you on the holy mountains side, and sent down on you the manna and the quails,
(Saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and transgress not in respect thereof lest My wrath come upon you: and he on whom My wrath cometh, he is lost indeed.
And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and doeth good, and afterward walketh aright.
And (it was said): What hath made thee hasten from thy folk, O Moses ?
He said: They are close upon my track. I hastened unto Thee, my Lord, that Thou mightest be well pleased.
He said: Lo! We have tried thy folk in thine absence, and As-Samiri hath misled them.
Then Moses went back unto his folk, angry and sad. He said: O my people! Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise ? Did the time appointed then appear too long for you, or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you, that ye broke tryst with me ?
They said: We broke not tryst with thee of our own will, but we were laden with burdens of ornaments of the folk, then cast them (in the fire), for thus As-Samiri proposed.
Then he produced for them a calf, of saffron hue, which gave forth a lowing sound. And they cried: This is your god and the god of Moses, but he hath forgotten.
See they not, then, that it returneth no saying unto them and possesseth for them neither hurt nor use ?
And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand: O my people! Ye are but being seduced therewith, for lo! your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my order.
They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries till Moses return unto us.
He (Moses) said: O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them gone astray,
That thou followedst me not ? Hast thou then disobeyed my order ?
He said: O son of my mother! Clutch not my beard nor my head! I feared lest thou shouldst say: Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel, and hast not waited for my word.
(Moses) said: And what hast thou to say, O Samiri ?
He said: I perceived what they perceive not, so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger, and then threw it in. Thus my soul commended to me.
(Moses) said: Then go! and lo! in this life it is for thee to say: Touch me not! and lo! there is for thee a tryst thou canst not break. Now look upon thy god of which thou hast remained a votary. Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea.
Your God is only Allah, than Whom there is no other God. He embraceth all things in His knowledge.
Thus relate We unto thee (Muhammad) some tidings of that which happened of old, and We have given thee from Our presence a reminder.
Whoso turneth away from it, he verily will bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection,
Abiding under it - an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection,
The day when the Trumpet is blown. On that day we assemble the guilty white-eyed (with terror),
Murmuring among themselves: Ye have tarried but ten (days).
We are Best Aware of what they utter when their best in conduct say: Ye have tarried but a day.
They will ask thee of the mountains (on that day). Say: My Lord will break them into scattered dust.
And leave it as an empty plain,
Wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness.
On that day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not, and voices are hushed for the Beneficent, and thou hearest but a faint murmur.
On that day no intercession availeth save (that of) him unto whom the Beneficent hath given leave and whose word He accepteth.
He knoweth (all) that is before them and (all) that is behind them, while they cannot compass it in knowledge.
And faces humble themselves before the Living, the Eternal. And he who beareth (a burden of) wrongdoing is indeed a failure (on that day).
And he who hath done some good works, being a believer, he feareth not injustice nor begrudging (of his wage).
Thus we have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic, and have displayed therein certain threats, that peradventure they may keep from evil or that it may cause them to take heed.
Then exalted be Allah, the True King! And hasten not (O Muhammad) with the Quran ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee, and say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.
And verily We made a covenant of old with Adam, but he forgot, and We found no constancy in him.
And when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, they fell prostrate (all) save Iblis; he refused.
Therefor we said: O Adam! This is an enemy unto thee and unto thy wife, so let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou come to toil.
It is (vouchsafed) unto thee that thou hungerest not therein nor art naked,
And that thou thirstest not therein nor art exposed to the suns heat.
But the devil whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away ?
Then they twain ate thereof, so that their shame became apparent unto them, and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden. And Adam disobeyed his Lord, so went astray.
Then his Lord chose him, and relented toward him, and guided him.
He said: Go down hence, both of you, one of you a foe unto the other. But when there come unto you from Me a guidance, then whoso followeth My guidance, he will not go astray nor come to grief.
But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me, his will be a narrow life, and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection.
He will say: My Lord! Wherefor hast Thou gathered me (hither) blind, when I was wont to see ?
He will say: So (it must be). Our revelations came unto thee but thou didst forget them. In like manner thou art forgotten this Day.
Thus do We reward him who is prodigal and believeth not the revelations of his Lord; and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting.
Is it not a guidance for them (to know) how many a generation We destroyed before them, amid whose dwellings they walk ? Lo! therein verily are signs for men of thought.
And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord, and a term already fixed, the judgment would have been inevitable (in this world).
Therefor (O Muhammad), bear with what they say, and celebrate the praise of thy Lord ere the rising of the sun and ere the going down thereof. And glorify Him some hours of the night and at the two ends of the day, that thou mayst find acceptance.
And strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoy, the flower of the life of the world, that We may try them thereby. The provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting.
And enjoin upon thy people worship, and be constant therein. We ask not of thee a provision: We provided for thee. And the sequel is for righteousness.
And they say: If only he would bring us a miracle from his Lord! Hath there not come unto them the proof of what is in the former scriptures ?
And if we had destroyed them with some punishment before it, they would assuredly have said: Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent unto us a messenger, so that we might have followed Thy revelations before we were (thus) humbled and disgraced!
Say: Each is awaiting; so await ye! Ye will come to know who are the owners of the path of equity, and who is right.
Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind, while they turn away in heedlessness.
Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen to it while they play,
With hearts preoccupied. And they confer in secret. The wrong-doers say: Is this other than a mortal like you ? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see (it) ?
He saith: My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
Nay, say they, (these are but) muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it; nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old (who were Gods messengers) were sent (with portents).
Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though We sent them portents): would they then believe ?
And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men, whom We inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not ?
We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals.
Then we fulfilled the promise unto them. So we delivered them and whom We would, and We destroyed the prodigals.
Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder. Have ye then no sense ?
How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up after them another folk!
And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it!
(But it was said unto them): Flee not, but return to that (existence) which emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned.
They cried: Alas for us! we were wrong-doers.
And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct.
We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play.
If We had wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in Our presence if We ever did.
Nay, but We hurl the true against the false, and it doth break its head and lo! it vanisheth. And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe (unto Him).
Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary;
They glorify (Him) night and day; they flag not.
Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead ?
If there were therein gods beside Allah, then verily both (the heavens and the earth) had been disordered. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from all that they ascribe (unto Him).
He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, but they will be questioned.
Or have they chosen other gods beside Him ? say: Bring your proof (of their godhead). This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me, but most of them know not the Truth and so they are averse.
And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, (saying): There is no God save Me (Allah), so worship Me.
And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He Glorified! Nay, but (those whom they call sons) are honoured slaves;
They speak not until He hath spoken, and they act by His command.
He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede except for him whom He accepteth, and they quake for awe of Him.
And one of them who should say: Lo! I am a god beside Him, that one We should repay with hell. Thus We Repay wrong-doers.
Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water ? Will they not then believe ?
And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way.
And we have made the sky a roof withheld (from them). Yet they turn away from its portents.
And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They float, each in an orbit.
We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee. What! if thou diest, can they be immortal!
Every soul must taste of death, and We try you with evil and with good, for ordeal. And unto Us ye will be returned.
And when those who disbelieve behold thee, they but choose thee out for mockery, (saying): Is this he who maketh mention of your gods ? And they would deny all mention of the Beneficent.
Man is made of haste. I shall show you My portents, but ask Me not to hasten.
And they say: When will this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ?
If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not be able to drive off the fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped!
Nay, but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them, and they will be unable to repel it, neither will they be reprieved.
Messengers before thee, indeed, were mocked, but that whereat they mocked surrounded those who scoffed at them.
Say: Who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the Beneficent ? Nay, but they turn away from mention of their Lord!
Or have they gods who can shield them from Us ? They cannot help themselves nor can they be defended from Us.
Nay, but We gave these and their fathers ease until life grew long for them. See they not how we aim to the land, reducing it of its outlying parts ? Can they then be the victors ?
Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I warn you only by the Inspiration. But the deaf hear not the call when they are warned.
And if a breath of thy Lords punishment were to touch them, they assuredly would say: Alas for us! Lo! we were wrong-doers.
And We set a just balance for the Day of Resurrection so that no soul is wronged in aught. Though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard seed, We bring it. And We suffice for reckoners.
And We verily gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion (of right and wrong) and a light and a Reminder for those who keep from evil,
Those who fear their Lord in secret and who dread the Hour (of doom).
This is a blessed Reminder that we have revealed: Will ye then reject it ?
And We verily gave Abraham of old his proper course, and We were Aware of him,
When he said unto his father and his folk: What are these images unto which ye pay devotion ?
They said: We found our fathers worshippers of them.
He said: Verily ye and your fathers were in plain error.
They said: Bringest thou unto us the truth, or art thou some jester ?
He said: Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who created them; and I am of those who testify unto that.
And, by Allah, I shall circumvent your idols after ye have gone away and turned your backs.
Then he reduced them to fragments, all save the chief of them, that haply they might have recourse to it.
They said: Who hath done this to our gods ? Surely it must be some evil-doer.
They said: We heard a youth make mention of them, who is called Abraham.
They said: Then bring him (hither) before the peoples eyes that they may testify.
They said: Is it thou who hast done this to our gods, O Abraham ?
He said: But this, their chief hath done it. So question them, if they can speak.
Then gathered they apart and said: Lo! ye yourselves are the wrong-doers.
And they were utterly confounded, and they said: Well thou knowest that these speak not.
He said: Worship ye then instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you ?
Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of Allah! Have ye then no sense ?
They cried: Burn him and stand by your gods, if ye will be doing.
We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham,
And they wished to set a snare for him, but We made them the greater losers.
And We rescued him and Lot (and brought them) to the land which We have blessed for (all) peoples.
And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and Jacob as a grandson. Each of them We made righteous.
And We made them chiefs who guide by Our command, and We inspired in them the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of alms, and they were worshippers of Us (alone).
And unto Lot we gave judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him from the community that did abominations. Lo! they were folk of evil, lewd.
And We brought him in unto Our mercy. Lo! he was of the righteous.
And Noah, when he cried of old, We heard his prayer and saved him and his household from the great affliction.
And delivered him from the people who denied Our revelations. Lo! they were folk of evil, therefor did We drown them all.
And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field, when peoples sheep had strayed and browsed therein by night; and We were witnesses to their judgment.
And We made Solomon to understand (the case); and unto each of them We gave judgment and knowledge. And we subdued the hills and the birds to hymn (His) praise along with David. We were the doers (thereof).
And We taught him the art of making garments (of mail) to protect you in your daring. Are ye then thankful ?
And unto Solomon (We subdued) the wind in its raging. It set by his command toward the land which We had blessed. And of everything We are Aware.
And of the evil ones (subdued We unto him) some who dived (for pearls) for him and did other work, and We were warders unto them.
And Job, when he cried unto his Lord, (saying): Lo! adversity afflicteth me, and Thou art Most Merciful of all who show mercy.
Then We heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he suffered, and We gave him his household (that he had lost) and the like thereof along with them, a mercy from Our store, and a remembrance for the worshippers;
And (mention) Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhul-Kifl. All were of the steadfast.
And We brought them in unto Our mercy. Lo! they are among the righteous.
And (mention) Dhun-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We had no power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no God save Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer.
Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save believers.
And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not childless, though Thou art the Best of inheritors.
Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his wife (to bear a child) for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good deeds, and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto Us.
And she who was chaste, therefor We breathed into her (something) of Our Spirit and made her and her son a token for (all) peoples.
Lo! this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.
And they have broken their religion (into fragments) among them, (yet) all are returning unto Us.
Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer, there will be no rejection of his effort. Lo! We record (it) for him.
And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed: that they shall not return.
Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they hasten out of every mound,
And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers!
Lo! ye (idolaters) and that which ye worship beside Allah are fuel of hell. Thereunto ye will come.
If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide therein.
Therein wailing is their portion, and therein they hear not.
Lo! those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from Us, they will be far removed from thence.
They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that which their souls desire.
The Supreme Horror will not grieve them, and the angels will welcome them, (saying): This is your Day which ye were promised;
The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written scroll. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise (binding) upon Us. Lo! We are to perform it.
And verily we have written in the Scripture, after the Reminder: My righteous slaves will inherit the earth:
Lo! there is a plain statement for folk who are devout.
We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples.
Say: It is only inspired in me that your God is One God. Will ye then surrender (unto Him) ?
But if they are averse, then say: I have warned you all alike, although I know not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised.
Lo! He knoweth that which is said openly, and that which ye conceal.
And I know not but that this may be a trial for you, and enjoyment for a while.
He saith: My Lord! Judge Thou with truth. Our Lord is the Beneficent, Whose help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe (unto Him).
O mankind! Fear your Lord. Lo! the earthquake of the Hour (of Doom) is a tremendous thing.
On the day when ye behold it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling and every pregnant one will be delivered of her burden, and thou (Muhammad) wilt see mankind as drunken, yet they will not be drunken, but the Doom of Allah will be strong (upon them).
Among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge, and followeth each froward devil;
For him it is decreed that whoso taketh him for friend, he verily will mislead him and will guide him to the punishment of the Flame.
O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make (it) clear for you. And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time, and afterward We bring you forth as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full strength. And among you there is he who dieth (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the most abject time of life, so that, after knowledge, he knoweth naught. And thou (Muhammad) seest the earth barren, but when We send down water thereon, it doth thrill and swell and put forth every lovely kind (of growth).
That is because Allah, He is the Truth and because He quickeneth the dead, and because He is Able to do all things;
And because the Hour will come, there is no doubt thereof; and because Allah will raise those who are in the graves.
And among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light,
Turning away in pride to beguile (men) from the way of Allah. For him in this world is ignominy, and on the Day of Resurrection We make him taste the doom of burning.
(And unto him it will be said): This is for that which thy two hands have sent before, and because Allah is no oppressor of His slaves.
And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge so that if good befalleth him he is content therewith, but if a trial befalleth him, he falleth away utterly. He loseth both the world and the Hereafter. That is the sheer loss.
He calleth, beside Allah, unto that which hurteth him not nor benefiteth him. That is the far error.
He calleth unto him whose harm is nearer than his benefit; verily an evil patron and verily an evil friend!
Lo! Allah causeth those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Lo! Allah doth what He intendeth.
Whoso is wont to think (through envy) that Allah will not give him (Muhammad) victory in the world and the Hereafter (and is enraged at the thought of his victory), let him stretch a rope up to the roof (of his dwelling), and let him hang himself. Then let him see whether his strategy dispelleth that whereat he rageth!.
Thus We reveal it as plain revelations, and verily Allah guideth whom He will.
Lo! those who believe (this revelation), and those who are Jews, and the Sabaeans and the Christians and the Magians and the idolaters - Lo! Allah will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! Allah is Witness over all things.
Hast thou not seen that unto Allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many of mankind, while there are many unto whom the doom is justly due. He whom Allah scorneth, there is none to give him honour. Lo! Allah doeth what He will.
These twain (the believers and the disbelievers) are two opponents who contend concerning their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads,
Whereby that which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted;
And for them are hooked rods of iron.
Whenever, in their anguish, they would go forth from thence they are driven back therein and (it is said unto them): Taste the doom of burning.
Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will be allowed armlets of gold, and pearls, and their raiment therein will be silk.
They are guided unto gentle speech; they are guided unto the path of the Glorious One.
Lo! those who disbelieve and bar (men) from the way of Allah and from the Inviolable Place of Worship, which We have appointed for mankind together, the dweller therein and the nomad: whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein, him We shall cause to taste a painful doom.
And (remember) when We prepared for Abraham the place of the (holy) House, saying: Ascribe thou no thing as partner unto Me, and purify My House for those who make the round (thereof) and those who stand and those who bow and make prostration.
And proclaim unto mankind the pilgrimage. They will come unto thee on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every deep ravine,
That they may witness things that are of benefit to them, and mention the name of Allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that He hath bestowed upon them. Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor unfortunate.
Then let them make an end of their unkemptness and pay their vows and go around the ancient House.
That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah, it will be well for him in the sight of his Lord. The cattle are lawful unto you save that which hath been told you. So shun the filth of idols, and shun lying speech,
Turning unto Allah (only), not ascribing partners unto Him; for whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had snatched him or the wind had blown him to a far-off place.
That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to Allah, it surely is from devotion of the hearts,
Therein are benefits for you for an appointed term; and afterward they are brought for sacrifice unto the ancient House.
And for every nation have We appointed a ritual, that they may mention the name of Allah over the beast of cattle that He hath given them for food; and your God is One God, therefor surrender unto Him. And give good tidings (O Muhammad) to the humble,
Whose hearts fear when Allah is mentioned, and the patient of whatever may befall them, and those who establish worship and who spend of that We have bestowed on them.
And the camels! We have appointed them among the ceremonies of Allah. Therein ye have much good. So mention the name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines. Then when their flanks fall (dead), eat thereof and feed the beggar and the suppliant. Thus have We made them subject unto you, that haply ye may give thanks.
Their flesh and their food reach not Allah, but the devotion from you reacheth Him. Thus have We made them subject unto you that ye may magnify Allah that He hath guided you. And give good tidings (O Muhammad) to the good.
Lo! Allah defendeth those who are true. Lo! Allah loveth not each treacherous ingrate.
Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged; and Allah is indeed Able to give them victory;
Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: Our Lord is Allah - For had it not been for Allahs repelling some men by means of others, cloisters and churches and oratories and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helpeth one who helpeth Him. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty -
Those who, if We give them power in the land, establish worship and pay the poor-due and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity. And Allahs is the sequel of events.
If they deny thee (Muhammad), even so the folk of Noah, and (the tribes of) Aad and Thamud, before thee, denied (Our messengers);
And the folk of Abraham and the folk of Lot;
(And) the dwellers in Midian. And Moses was denied; but I indulged the disbelievers a long while, then I seized them, and how (terrible) was My abhorrence!
How many a township have We destroyed while it was sinful, so that it lieth (to this day) in ruins, and (how many) a deserted well and lofty tower!
Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel and ears wherewith to hear ? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind.
And they will bid thee hasten on the Doom, and Allah faileth not His promise, but lo! a Day with Allah is as a thousand years of what ye reckon.
And how many a township did I suffer long though it was sinful! Then I grasped it. Unto Me is the return.
Say: O mankind! I am only a plain warner unto you.
Those who believe and do good works, for them is pardon and a rich provision;
While those who strive to thwart Our revelations, such are rightful owners of the Fire.
Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise;
That He may make that which the devil proposeth a temptation for those in whose hearts is a disease, and those whose hearts are hardened - Lo! the evil-doers are in open schism -
And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from thy Lord, so that they may believe therein and their hearts may submit humbly unto Him. Lo! Allah verily is guiding those who believe unto a right path.
And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the Hour come upon them unawares, or there come unto them the doom of a disastrous day.
The Sovereignty on that day will be Allahs, He will judge between them. Then those who believed and did good works will be in Gardens of Delight,
While those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, for them will be a shameful doom.
Those who fled their homes for the cause of Allah and then were slain or died, Allah verily will provide for them a good provision. Lo! Allah, He verily is Best of all who make provision.
Assuredly He will cause them to enter by an entry that they will love. Lo! Allah verily is Knower, Indulgent.
That (is so). And whoso hath retaliated with the like of that which he was made to suffer and then hath (again) been wronged, Allah will succour him. Lo! Allah verily is Mild, Forgiving.
That is because Allah maketh the night to pass into the day and maketh the day to pass into the night, and because Allah is Hearer, Seer.
That is because Allah, He is the True, and that whereon they call instead of Him, it is the false, and because Allah, He is the High, the Great.
Seest thou not how Allah sendeth down water from the sky and then the earth becometh green upon the morrow ? Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware.
Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Lo! Allah, He verily is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise.
Hast thou not seen how Allah hath made all that is in the earth subservient unto you ? And the ship runneth upon the sea by His command, and He holdeth back the heaven from falling on the earth unless by His leave. Lo! Allah is, for mankind, Full of Pity, Merciful.
And He it is Who gave you life, then He will cause you to die, and then will give you life (again). Lo! man is verily an ingrate.
Unto each nation have We given sacred rites which they are to perform; so let them not dispute with thee of the matter, but summon thou unto thy Lord. Lo! thou indeed followest right guidance.
And if they wrangle with thee, say: Allah is Best Aware of what ye do.
Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein ye used to differ.
Hast thou not known that Allah knoweth all that is in the heaven and the earth ? Lo! it is in a record. Lo! that is easy for Allah.
And they worship instead of Allah that for which He hath sent down no warrant, and that whereof they have no knowledge. For evil-doers there is no helper.
And when Our revelations are recited unto them, thou knowest the denial in the faces of those who disbelieve; they all but attack those who recite Our revelations unto them. Say: Shall I proclaim unto you worse than that ? The Fire! Allah hath promised it for those who disbelieve. A hapless journeys end!
O mankind! A similitude is coined, so pay ye heed to it: Lo! those on whom ye call beside Allah will never create a fly though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly took something from them, they could not rescue it from it. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought!
They measure not Allah His rightful measure. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty.
Allah chooseth from the angels messengers, and (also) from mankind. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Seer.
He knoweth all that is before them and all that is behind them, and unto Allah all things are returned.
O ye who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord, and do good, that haply ye may prosper.
And strive for Allah with the endeavour which is His right. He hath chosen you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship; the faith of your father Abraham (is yours). He hath named you Muslims of old time and in this (Scripture), that the messenger may be a witness against you, and that ye may be witnesses against mankind. So establish worship, pay the poor-due, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protecting friend. A blessed Patron and a blessed Helper!
Successful indeed are the believers
Who are humble in their prayers,
And who shun vain conversation,
And who are payers of the poor-due;
And who guard their modesty -
Save from their wives or the (slaves) that their right hands possess, for then they are not blameworthy,
But whoso craveth beyond that, such are transgressors -
And who are shepherds of their pledge and their covenant,
And who pay heed to their prayers.
These are the heirs
Who will inherit paradise. There they will abide.
Verily We created man from a product of wet earth;
Then placed him as a drop (of seed) in a safe lodging;
Then fashioned We the drop a clot, then fashioned We the clot a little lump, then fashioned We the little lump bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then produced it as another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators!
Then lo! after that ye surely die.
Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection ye are raised (again).
And We have created above you seven paths, and We are never unmindful of creation.
And we send down from the sky water in measure, and We give it lodging in the earth, and lo! We are Able to withdraw it.
Then We produce for you therewith gardens of date-palms and grapes, wherein is much fruit for you and whereof ye eat;
And a tree that springeth forth from Mount Sinai that groweth oil and relish for the eaters.
And lo! in the cattle there is verily a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, and many uses have ye in them, and of them do ye eat;
And on them and on the ship ye are carried.
And We verily sent Noah unto his folk, and he said: O my people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
But the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: This is only a mortal like you who would make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely could have sent down angels. We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old.
He is only a man in whom is a madness, so watch him for a while.
He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me.
Then We inspired in him, saying: Make the ship under Our eyes and Our inspiration. Then, when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce therein of every (kind) two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against whom the Word hath already gone forth. And plead not with Me on behalf of those who have done wrong. Lo! they will be drowned.
And when thou art on board the ship, thou and whoso is with thee, then say: Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk!
And say: My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing-place, for Thou art Best of all who bring to land.
Lo! herein verily are portents, for lo! We are ever putting (mankind) to the test.
Then, after them, We brought forth another generation;
And we sent among them a messenger of their own, saying: Serve Allah, Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
And the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter, and whom We had made soft in the life of the world, said: This is only a mortal like you, who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink.
If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves, then, lo! ye surely would be losers.
Doth he promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust and bones, will (again) be brought forth ?
Begone, begone, with that which ye are promised!
There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and we shall not be raised (again).
He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah. We are not going to put faith in him.
He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me.
He said: In a little while they surely will become repentant.
So the (Awful) Cry overtook them rightfully, and We made them like as wreckage (that a torrent hurleth). A far removal for wrongdoing folk!
Then after them We brought forth other generations.
No nation can outstrip its term, nor yet postpone it.
Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came unto a nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another (to disaster) and We made them bywords. A far removal for folk who believe not!
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our tokens and a clear warrant
Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned (them) and they were despotic folk.
And they said: Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves, and whose folk are servile unto us ?
So they denied them, and became of those who were destroyed.
And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, that haply they might go aright.
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a portent, and We gave them refuge on a height, a place of flocks and watersprings.
O ye messengers! Eat of the good things, and do right. Lo! I am Aware of what ye do.
And lo! this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your duty unto Me.
But they (mankind) have broken their religion among them into sects, each group rejoicing in its tenets.
So leave them in their error till a time.
Think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them
We hasten unto them with good things ? Nay, but they perceive not.
Lo! those who go in awe for fear of their Lord.
And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord,
And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord,
And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are about to return unto their Lord,
These race for the good things, and they shall win them in the race.
And we task not any soul beyond its scope, and with Us is a Record which speaketh the truth, and they will not be wronged.
Nay, but their hearts are in ignorance of this (Quran), and they have other works, besides, which they are doing;
Till when We grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment, behold! they supplicate.
Supplicate not this day! Assuredly ye will not be helped by Us.
My revelations were recited unto you, but ye used to turn back on your heels,
In scorn thereof. Nightly did ye rave together.
Have they not pondered the Word, or hath that come unto them which came not unto their fathers of old ?
Or know they not their messenger, and so reject him ?
Or say they: There is a madness in him ? Nay, but he bringeth them the Truth; and most of them are haters of the Truth.
And if the Truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein had been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them their Reminder, but from their Reminder they now turn away.
Or dost thou ask of them (O Muhammad) any tribute ? But the bounty of thy Lord is better, for He is Best of all who make provision.
And lo! thou summonest them indeed unto a straight path.
And lo! those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed astray from the path.
Though We had mercy on them and relieved them of the harm afflicting them, they still would wander blindly on in their contumacy.
Already have We grasped them with punishment, but they humble not themselves unto their Lord, nor do they pray,
Until, when We open for them the gate of extreme punishment, behold! they are aghast thereat.
He it is Who hath created for you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give ye!
And He it is Who hath sown you broadcast in the earth, and unto Him ye will be gathered.
And He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and His is the difference of night and day. Have ye then no sense ?
Nay, but they say the like of that which said the men of old;
They say: When we are dead and have become (mere) dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again ?
We were already promised this, we and our forefathers. Lo! this is naught but fables of the men of old.
Say: Unto Whom (belongeth) the earth and whosoever is therein, if ye have knowledge ?
They will say: Unto Allah. Say: Will ye not then remember ?
Say: Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Tremendous Throne ?
They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: Will ye not then keep duty (unto Him) ?
Say: In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and He protecteth, while against Him there is no protection, if ye have knowledge ?
They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: How then are ye bewitched ?
Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars.
Allah hath not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him; else would each god have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be Allah above all that they allege.
Knower of the Invisible and the Visible! and Exalted be He over all that they ascribe as partners (unto Him)!
Say: My Lord! If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised.
My Lord! then set me not among the wrongdoing folk.
And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them.
Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best Aware of that which they allege.
And say: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones,
And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they be present with me,
Until, when death cometh unto one of them, he saith: My Lord! Send me back,
That I may do right in that which I have left behind! But nay! It is but a word that he speaketh; and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are raised.
And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that day, nor will they ask of one another.
Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful.
And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls, in hell abiding.
The fire burneth their faces, and they are glum therein.
(It will be said): Were not My revelations recited unto you, and then ye used to deny them ?
They will say: Our Lord! Our evil fortune conquered us, and we were erring folk.
Our Lord! Oh, bring us forth from hence! If we return (to evil) then indeed we shall be wrong-doers.
He saith: Begone therein, and speak not unto Me.
Lo! there was a party of My slaves who said: Our Lord! We believe, therefor forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of all who show mercy;
But ye chose them for a laughing-stock until they caused you to forget remembrance of Me, while ye laughed at them.
Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast in that they, even they, are the triumphant.
He will say: How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years ?
They will say: We tarried by a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep count!
He will say: Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew.
Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not be returned unto Us ?
Now Allah be Exalted, the True King! There is no God save Him, the Lord of the Throne of Grace.
He who crieth unto any other god along with Allah hath no proof thereof. His reckoning is only with his Lord. Lo! disbelievers will not be successful.
And (O Muhammad) say: My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for Thou art Best of all who show mercy.
(Here is) a surah which We have revealed and enjoined, and wherein We have revealed plain tokens, that haply ye may take heed.
The adulterer and the adulteress, scourge ye each one of them (with) a hundred stripes. And let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of believers witness their punishment.
The adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress, and the adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater. All that is forbidden unto believers.
And those who accuse honourable women but bring not four witnesses, scourge them (with) eighty stripes and never (afterward) accept their testimony - They indeed are evil-doers -
Save those who afterward repent and make amends. (For such) lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
As for those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses except themselves; let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies, (swearing) by Allah that he is of those who speak the truth;
And yet a fifth, invoking the curse of Allah on him if he is of those who lie.
And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bear witness before Allah four times that the thing he saith is indeed false,
And a fifth (time) that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaketh truth.
And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that Allah is Clement, Wise, (ye had been undone).
Lo! they who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not a bad thing for you; nay, it is good for you. Unto every man of them (will be paid) that which he hath earned of the sin; and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be an awful doom.
Why did not the believers, men and women, when ye heard it, think good of their own own folk, and say: It is a manifest untruth ?
Why did they not produce four witnesses ? Since they produce not witnesses, they verily are liars in the sight of Allah.
Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you in the world and the Hereafter an awful doom had overtaken you for that whereof ye murmured.
When ye welcomed it with your tongues, and uttered with your mouths that whereof ye had no knowledge, ye counted it a trifle. In the sight of Allah it is very great.
Wherefor, when ye heard it, said ye not: It is not for us to speak of this. Glory be to Thee (O Allah)! This is awful calumny.
Allah admonisheth you that ye repeat not the like thereof ever, if ye are (in truth) believers.
And He expoundeth unto you the revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise.
Lo! those who love that slander should be spread concerning those who believe, theirs will be a painful punishment in the world and the Hereafter. Allah knoweth. Ye know not.
Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that Allah is Clement, Merciful, (ye had been undone).
O ye who believe! Follow not the footsteps of the devil. Unto whomsoever followeth the footsteps of the devil, lo! he commandeth filthiness and wrong. Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, not one of you would ever have grown pure. But Allah causeth whom He will to grow. And Allah is Hearer, Knower.
And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear not to give to the near of kin and to the needy, and to fugitives for the cause of Allah. Let them forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you ? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Lo! as for those who traduce virtuous, believing women (who are) careless, cursed are they in the world and the Hereafter. Theirs will be an awful doom
On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet testify against them as to what they used to do,
On that day Allah will pay them their just due, and they will know that Allah, He is the Manifest Truth.
Vile women are for vile men, and vile men for vile women. Good women are for good men, and good men for good women; such are innocent of that which people say: For them is pardon and a bountiful provision.
O ye who believe! Enter not houses other than your own without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof. That is better for you, that ye may be heedful.
And if ye find no-one therein, still enter not until permission hath been given. And if it be said unto you: Go away again, then go away, for it is purer for you. Allah knoweth what ye do.
(It is) no sin for you to enter uninhabited houses wherein is comfort for you. Allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide.
Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do.
And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands or fathers or husbands fathers, or their sons or their husbands sons, or their brothers or their brothers sons or sisters sons, or their women, or their slaves, or male attendants who lack vigour, or children who know naught of womens nakedness. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And turn unto Allah together, O believers, in order that ye may succeed.
And marry such of you as are solitary and the pious of your slaves and maid-servants. If they be poor, Allah will enrich them of His bounty. Allah is of ample means, Aware.
And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste till Allah give them independence by His grace. And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation), write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them, and bestow upon them of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you. Force not your slave-girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world, if they would preserve their chastity. And if one force them, then (unto them), after their compulsion, lo! Allah will be Forgiving, Merciful.
And verily We have sent down for you revelations that make plain, and the example of those who passed away before you. An admonition unto those who ward off (evil).
Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The similitude of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as it were a shining star. (This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself) though no fire touched it. Light upon light. Allah guideth unto His light whom He will. And Allah speaketh to mankind in allegories, for Allah is Knower of all things.
(This lamp is found) in houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted and that His name shall be remembered therein. Therein do offer praise to Him at morn and evening.
Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remembrance of Allah and constancy in prayer and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when hearts and eyeballs will be overturned;
That Allah may reward them with the best of what they did, and increase reward for them of His bounty. Allah giveth blessings without stint to whom He will.
As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are as a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one supposeth it to be water till he cometh unto it and findeth it naught, and findeth, in the place thereof, Allah Who payeth him his due; and Allah is swift at reckoning.
Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea. There covereth him a wave, above which is a wave, above which is a cloud. Layer upon layer of darkness. When he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it. And he for whom Allah hath not appointed light, for him there is no light.
Hast thou not seen that Allah, He it is Whom all who are in the heavens and the earth praise, and the birds in their flight ? Of each He knoweth verily the worship and the praise; and Allah is Aware of what they do.
And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah is the journeying.
Hast thou not seen how Allah wafteth the clouds, then gathereth them, then maketh them layers, and thou seest the rain come forth from between them; He sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail, and smiteth therewith whom He will, and averteth it from whom He will. The flashing of His lightning all but snatcheth away the sight.
Allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night. Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for those who see.
Allah hath created every animal of water. Of them is (a kind) that goeth upon its belly and (a kind) that goeth upon two legs and (a kind) that goeth upon four. Allah createth what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.
Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them. Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path.
And they say: We believe in Allah and the messenger, and we obey; then after that a faction of them turn away. Such are not believers.
And when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them, lo! a faction of them are averse;
But if right had been with them they would have come unto him willingly.
Is there in their hearts a disease, or have they doubts, or fear they lest Allah and His messenger should wrong them in judgment ? Nay, but such are evil-doers.
The saying of (all true) believers when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them is only that they say: We hear and we obey. And such are the successful.
He who obeyeth Allah and His messenger, and feareth Allah, and keepeth duty (unto Him): such indeed are the victorious.
They swear by Allah solemnly that, if thou order them, they will go forth. Say: Swear not; known obedience (is better). Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do.
Say: Obey Allah and obey the messenger. But if ye turn away, then (it is) for him (to do) only that wherewith he hath been charged, and for you (to do) only that wherewith ye have been charged. If ye obey him, ye will go aright. But the messenger hath no other charge than to convey (the message) plainly.
Allah hath promised such of you as believe and do good work that He will surely make them to succeed (the present rulers) in the earth even as He caused those who were before them to succeed (others); and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He hath approved for them, and will give them in exchange safety after their fear. They serve Me. They ascribe no thing as partner unto Me. Those who disbelieve henceforth, they are the miscreants.
Establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey the messenger, that haply ye may find mercy.
Think not that the disbelievers can escape in the land. Fire will be their home - a hapless journeys end!
O ye who believe! Let your slaves, and those of you who have not come to puberty, ask leave of you at three times (before they come into your presence): Before the prayer of dawn, and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. Three times of privacy for you. It is no sin for them or for you at other times, when some of you go round attendant upon others (if they come into your presence without leave). Thus Allah maketh clear the revelations for you. Allah is Knower, Wise.
And when the children among you come to puberty then let them ask leave even as those before them used to ask it. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for you. Allah is Knower, Wise.
As for women past child-bearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no sin for them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show adornment. But to refrain is better for them. Allah is Hearer, Knower.
No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers brothers, or the houses of your fathers sisters, or the houses of your mothers brothers, or the houses of your mothers sisters, or (from that) whereof ye hold the keys, or (from the house) of a friend. No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together or apart. But when ye enter houses, salute one another with a greeting from Allah, blessed and sweet. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for you, that haply ye may understand.
They only are the true believers who believe in Allah and His messenger and, when they are with him on some common errand, go not away until they have asked leave of him. Lo! those who ask leave of thee, those are they who believe in Allah and His messenger. So, if they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs, give leave to whom thou wilt of them, and ask for them forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of another. Allah knoweth those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall them.
Lo! verily unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. He knoweth your condition. And (He knoweth) the Day when they are returned unto Him so that He may inform them of what they did. Allah is Knower of all things.
Blessed is He Who hath revealed unto His slave the Criterion (of right and wrong), that he may be a warner to the peoples.
He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He hath chosen no son nor hath He any partner in the Sovereignty. He hath created everything and hath meted out for it a measure.
Yet they choose beside Him other gods who create naught but are themselves created, and possess not hurt nor profit for themselves, and possess not death nor life, nor power to raise the dead.
Those who disbelieve say: This is naught but a lie that he hath invented, and other folk have helped him with it, so that they have produced a slander and a lie.
And they say: Fables of the men of old which he hath had written down so that they are dictated to him morn and evening.
Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He who knoweth the secret of the heavens and the earth hath revealed it. Lo! He ever is Forgiving, Merciful.
And they say: What aileth this messenger (of Allah) that he eateth food and walketh in the markets ? Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a warner with him.
Or (why is not) treasure thrown down unto him, or why hath he not a paradise from whence to eat ? And the evil-doers say: Ye are but following a man bewitched.
See how they coin similitudes for thee, so that they are all astray and cannot find a road!
Blessed is He Who, if He will, will assign thee better than (all) that - Gardens underneath which rivers flow - and will assign thee mansions.
Nay, but they deny (the coming of) the Hour, and for those who deny (the coming of) the Hour We have prepared a flame.
When it seeth them from afar, they hear the crackling and the roar thereof.
And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they pray for destruction there.
Pray not that day for one destruction, but pray for many destructions!
Say: Is that (doom) better or the Garden of Immortality which is promised unto those who ward off (evil) ? It will be their reward and journeys end.
Therein abiding, they have all that they desire. It is for thy Lord a promise that must be fulfilled.
And on the day when He will assemble them and that which they worship instead of Allah and will say: Was it ye who misled these my slaves or did they (themselves) wander from the way ?
They will say: Be Thou Glorified! it was not for us to choose any protecting friends beside thee; but Thou didst give them and their fathers ease till they forgot the warning and became lost folk.
Thus they will give you the lie regarding what ye say, then ye can neither avert (the doom) nor obtain help. And whoso among you doeth wrong, We shall make him taste great torment.
We never sent before thee any messengers but lo! they verily ate food and walked in the markets. And We have appointed some of you a test for others: Will ye be steadfast ? And thy Lord is ever Seer.
And those who look not for a meeting with Us say: Why are angels not sent down unto us and (Why) do we not see our Lord! Assuredly they think too highly of themselves and are scornful with great pride.
On the day when they behold the angels, on that day there will be no good tidings for the guilty; and they will cry: A forbidding ban!
And We shall turn unto the work they did and make it scattered motes.
Those who have earned the Garden on that day will be better in their home and happier in their place of noonday rest;
A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder and the angels will be sent down, a grand descent.
The Sovereignty on that day will be the True (Sovereignty) belonging to the Beneficent One, and it will be a hard day for disbelievers.
On the day when the wrong-doer gnaweth his hands, he will say: Ah, would that I had chosen a way together with the messenger (of Allah)!
Alas for me! Ah, would that I had never taken such an one for friend!
He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan was ever mans deserter in the hour of need.
And the messenger saith: O my Lord! Lo! mine own folk make this Quran of no account.
Even so have We appointed unto every prophet an opponent from among the guilty; but Allah sufficeth for a Guide and Helper.
And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Quran not revealed unto him all at once ? (It is revealed) thus that We may strengthen thy heart therewith; and We have arranged it in right order.
And they bring thee no similitude but We bring thee the Truth (as against it), and better (than their similitude) as argument.
Those who will be gathered on their faces unto hell: such are worse in plight and further from the right road.
We verily gave Moses the Scripture and placed with him his brother Aaron as henchman.
Then We said: Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations. Then We destroyed them, a complete destruction.
And Noahs folk, when they denied the messengers, We drowned them and made of them a portent for mankind. We have prepared a painful doom for evil-doers.
And (the tribes of) Aad and Thamud, and the dwellers in Ar-Rass, and many generations in between.
Each (of them) We warned by examples, and each (of them) We brought to utter ruin.
And indeed they have passed by the township whereon was rained the fatal rain. Can it be that they have not seen it ? Nay, but they hope for no resurrection.
And when they see thee (O Muhammad) they treat thee only as a jest (saying): Is this he whom Allah sendeth as a messenger ?
He would have led us far away from our gods if we had not been staunch to them. They will know, when they behold the doom, who is more astray as to the road.
Hast thou seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust ? Wouldst thou then be guardian over him ?
Or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand ? They are but as the cattle - nay, but they are farther astray ?
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord hath spread the shade - And if He willed He could have made it still - then We have made the sun its pilot;
Then We withdraw it unto Us, a gradual withdrawal ?
And He it is Who maketh night a covering for you, and sleep repose, and maketh day a resurrection.
And He it is Who sendeth the winds, glad tidings heralding His mercy, and We send down purifying water from the sky,
That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give many beasts and men that We have created to drink thereof.
And verily We have repeated it among them that they may remember, but most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude.
If We willed, We could raise up a warner in every village.
So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them herewith with a great endeavour.
And He it is Who hath given independence to the two seas (though they meet); one palatable, sweet, and the other saltish, bitter; and hath set a bar and a forbidding ban between them.
And He it is Who hath created man from water, and hath appointed for him kindred by blood and kindred by marriage; for thy Lord is ever Powerful.
Yet they worship instead of Allah that which can neither benefit them nor hurt them. The disbeliever was ever a partisan against his Lord.
And We have sent thee (O Muhammad) only as a bearer of good tidings and a warner.
Say: I ask of you no reward for this, save that whoso will may choose a way unto his Lord.
And trust thou in the Living One Who dieth not, and hymn His praise. He sufficeth as the Knower of His bondmens sins,
Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days, then He mounted the Throne. The Beneficent! Ask anyone informed concerning Him!
And when it is said unto them: Adore the Beneficent! they say: And what is the Beneficent ? Are we to adore whatever thou (Muhammad) biddest us ? And it increaseth aversion in them.
Blessed be He Who hath placed in the heaven mansions of the stars, and hath placed therein a great lamp and a moon giving light!
And He it is Who hath appointed night and day in succession, for him who desireth to remember, or desireth thankfulness.
The (faithful) slaves of the Beneficent are they who walk upon the earth modestly, and when the foolish ones address them answer: Peace;
And who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing,
And who say: Our Lord! Avert from us the doom of hell; lo! the doom thereof is anguish;
Lo! it is wretched as abode and station;
And those who, when they spend, are neither prodigal nor grudging; and there is ever a firm station between the two;
And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in (course of) justice, nor commit adultery - and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty;
The doom will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein disdained for ever;
Save him who repenteth and believeth and doth righteous work; as for such, Allah will change their evil deeds to good deeds. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.
And whosoever repenteth and doeth good, he verily repenteth toward Allah with true repentance -
And those who will not witness vanity, but when they pass near senseless play, pass by with dignity.
And those who, when they are reminded of the revelations of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat.
And who say: Our Lord! Vouchsafe us comfort of our wives and of our offspring, and make us patterns for (all) those who ward off (evil).
They will be awarded the high place forasmuch as they were steadfast, and they will meet therein with welcome and the ward of peace,
Abiding there for ever. Happy is it as abode and station!
Say (O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers): My Lord would not concern Himself with you but for your prayer. But now ye have denied (the Truth), therefor there will be judgment.
Ta. Sin. Mim.
These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain.
It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe not.
If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it.
Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but they turn away from it.
Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff.
Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein ?
Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers.
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk,
The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil) ?
He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me,
And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor send for Aaron (to help me).
And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me.
He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing.
And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds,
(Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us.
(Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child ? And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us,
And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates.
He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray.
Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him).
And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel.
Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ?
(Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief.
(Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ?
He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers.
(Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman!
He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did but understand.
(Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners.
He said: Even though I show thee something plain ?
(Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful!
Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest,
And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders.
(Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing wizard,
Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye ?
They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities summoners
Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard.
So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed.
And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ?
(They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners.
And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners ?
He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me).
Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw!
Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaohs might, lo! we verily are the winners.
Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely show.
And the wizards were flung prostrate,
Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,
The Lord of Moses and Aaron.
(Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you every one.
They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return.
Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers.
And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued.
Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners,
(Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop,
And lo! they are offenders against us.
And lo! we are a ready host.
Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings,
And treasures and a fair estate.
Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.
And they overtook them at sunrise.
And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are indeed caught.
He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me.
Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted, and each part was as a mountain vast.
Then brought We near the others to that place.
And We saved Moses and those with him, every one;
And We drowned the others.
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
Recite unto them the story of Abraham:
When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye ?
They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them.
He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ?
Or do they benefit or harm you ?
They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise.
He said: See now that which ye worship,
Ye and your forefathers!
Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds,
Who created me, and He doth guide me,
And Who feedeth me and watereth me.
And when I sicken, then He healeth me,
And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again),
And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment.
My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous.
And give unto me a good report in later generations.
And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight,
And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err.
And abase me not on the day when they are raised,
The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man)
Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart.
And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil).
And hell will appear plainly to the erring.
And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship
Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or help themselves ?
Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers
And the hosts of Iblis, together.
And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein:
By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest
When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds.
It was but the guilty who misled us.
Now we have no intercessors
Nor any loving friend.
Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers!
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers!
And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
Noahs folk denied the messengers (of Allah),
When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.
They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow thee ?
He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in the past) ?
Lo! their reckoning is my Lords concern, if ye but knew;
And I am not (here) to repulse believers.
I am only a plain warner.
They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned (to death).
He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me.
Therefor judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and those believers who are with me.
And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.
Then afterward We drowned the others.
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
(The tribe of) Aad denied the messengers (of Allah).
When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight ?
And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever ?
And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants ?
Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.
Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that ye know,
Hath aided you with cattle and sons.
And gardens and watersprings.
Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day.
They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who preach;
This is but a fable of the men of old,
And we shall not be doomed.
And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
(The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of Allah)
When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us,
In gardens and watersprings.
And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees,
Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful ?
Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me,
And obey not the command of the prodigal,
Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not.
They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched;
Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful.
He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well), and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day.
And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful day.
But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent.
So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
The folk of Lot denied the messengers (of Allah),
When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males,
And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay, but ye are froward folk.
They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast.
He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct.
My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do.
So We saved him and his household, every one,
Save an old woman among those who stayed behind.
Then afterward We destroyed the others.
And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned.
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.
And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of Allah),
When Shueyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ?
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.
And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.
Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due).
And weigh with the true balance.
Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the earth.
And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old.
They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched;
Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars.
Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful.
He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do.
But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day.
Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers.
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.
And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds,
Which the True Spirit hath brought down
Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners,
In plain Arabic speech.
And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old.
Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it ?
And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs,
And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it.
Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty.
They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom,
So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not.
Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved ?
Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ?
Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years,
And then cometh that which they were promised,
(How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them ?
And We destroyed no township but it had its warners
For reminder, for We never were oppressors.
The devils did not bring it down.
It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power,
Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing.
Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed.
And warn thy tribe of near kindred,
And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee.
And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they do.
And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful.
Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray)
And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship).
Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower.
Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend ?
They descend on every sinful, false one.
They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars.
As for poets, the erring follow them.
Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley,
And how they say that which they do not ?
Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned!
