Ta, Seen. These are the verses of the Qur’an and a clear Book
As guidance and good tidings for the believers
Who establish prayer and give zakah, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].
Indeed, for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have made pleasing to them their deeds, so they wander blindly.
Those are the ones for whom there will be the worst of punishment, and in the Hereafter they are the greatest losers.
And indeed, [O Muhammad], you receive the Qur’an from one Wise and Knowing.
[Mention] when Moses said to his family, "Indeed, I have perceived a fire. I will bring you from there information or will bring you a burning torch that you may warm yourselves."
But when he came to it, he was called, "Blessed is whoever is at the fire and whoever is around it. And exalted is Allah, Lord of the worlds.
O Moses, indeed it is I - Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."
And [he was told], "Throw down your staff." But when he saw it writhing as if it were a snake, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], "O Moses, fear not. Indeed, in My presence the messengers do not fear.
Otherwise, he who wrongs, then substitutes good after evil - indeed, I am Forgiving and Merciful.
And put your hand into the opening of your garment [at the breast]; it will come out white without disease. [These are] among the nine signs [you will take] to Pharaoh and his people. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient."
But when there came to them Our visible signs, they said, "This is obvious magic."
And they rejected them, while their [inner] selves were convinced thereof, out of injustice and haughtiness. So see how was the end of the corrupters.
And We had certainly given to David and Solomon knowledge, and they said, "Praise [is due] to Allah, who has favored us over many of His believing servants."
And Solomon inherited David. He said, "O people, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from all things. Indeed, this is evident bounty."
And gathered for Solomon were his soldiers of the jinn and men and birds, and they were [marching] in rows.
Until, when they came upon the valley of the ants, an ant said, "O ants, enter your dwellings that you not be crushed by Solomon and his soldiers while they perceive not."
So [Solomon] smiled, amused at her speech, and said, "My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve. And admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants."
And he took attendance of the birds and said, "Why do I not see the hoopoe - or is he among the absent?
I will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me clear authorization."
But the hoopoe stayed not long and said, "I have encompassed [in knowledge] that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from Sheba with certain news.
Indeed, I found [there] a woman ruling them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a great throne.
I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from [His] way, so they are not guided,
[And] so they do not prostrate to Allah, who brings forth what is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare -
Allah - there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Great Throne."
[Solomon] said, "We will see whether you were truthful or were of the liars.
Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them. Then leave them and see what [answer] they will return."
She said, "O eminent ones, indeed, to me has been delivered a noble letter.
Indeed, it is from Solomon, and indeed, it reads: ‘In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,
Be not haughty with me but come to me in submission [as Muslims].’ "
She said, "O eminent ones, advise me in my affair. I would not decide a matter until you witness [for] me."
They said, "We are men of strength and of great military might, but the command is yours, so see what you will command."
She said, "Indeed kings - when they enter a city, they ruin it and render the honored of its people humbled. And thus do they do.
But indeed, I will send to them a gift and see with what [reply] the messengers will return."
So when they came to Solomon, he said, "Do you provide me with wealth? But what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. Rather, it is you who rejoice in your gift.
Return to them, for we will surely come to them with soldiers that they will be powerless to encounter, and we will surely expel them therefrom in humiliation, and they will be debased."
[Solomon] said, "O assembly [of jinn], which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"
A powerful one from among the jinn said, "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for this [task] strong and trustworthy."
Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, "I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you." And when [Solomon] saw it placed before him, he said, "This is from the favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful - his gratitude is only for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever is ungrateful - then indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous."
He said, "Disguise for her her throne; we will see whether she will be guided [to truth] or will be of those who is not guided."
So when she arrived, it was said [to her], "Is your throne like this?" She said, "[It is] as though it was it." [Solomon said], "And we were given knowledge before her, and we have been Muslims [in submission to Allah].
And that which she was worshipping other than Allah had averted her [from submission to Him]. Indeed, she was from a disbelieving people."
She was told, "Enter the palace." But when she saw it, she thought it was a body of water and uncovered her shins [to wade through]. He said, "Indeed, it is a palace [whose floor is] made smooth with glass." She said, "My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, Lord of the worlds."
And We had certainly sent to Thamud their brother Salih, [saying], "Worship Allah," and at once they were two parties conflicting.
He said, "O my people, why are you impatient for evil instead of good? Why do you not seek forgiveness of Allah that you may receive mercy?"
They said, "We consider you a bad omen, you and those with you." He said, "Your omen is with Allah. Rather, you are a people being tested."
And there were in the city nine family heads causing corruption in the land and not amending [its affairs].
They said, "Take a mutual oath by Allah that we will kill him by night, he and his family. Then we will say to his executor, ‘We did not witness the destruction of his family, and indeed, we are truthful.’ "
And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.
Then look how was the outcome of their plan - that We destroyed them and their people, all.
So those are their houses, desolate because of the wrong they had done. Indeed in that is a sign for people who know.
And We saved those who believed and used to fear Allah.
And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, "Do you commit immorality while you are seeing?
Do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly."
But the answer of his people was not except that they said, "Expel the family of Lot from your city. Indeed, they are people who keep themselves pure."
So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; We destined her to be of those who remained behind.
And We rained upon them a rain [of stones], and evil was the rain of those who were warned.
Say, [O Muhammad], "Praise be to Allah, and peace upon His servants whom He has chosen. Is Allah better or what they associate with Him?"
[More precisely], is He [not best] who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky, causing to grow thereby gardens of joyful beauty which you could not [otherwise] have grown the trees thereof? Is there a deity with Allah? [No], but they are a people who ascribe equals [to Him].
Is He [not best] who made the earth a stable ground and placed within it rivers and made for it firmly set mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier? Is there a deity with Allah? [No], but most of them do not know.
Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Little do you remember.
Is He [not best] who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy? Is there a deity with Allah? High is Allah above whatever they associate with Him.
Is He [not best] who begins creation and then repeats it and who provides for you from the heaven and earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Say, "Produce your proof, if you should be truthful."
Say, "None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah, and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected."
Rather, their knowledge is arrested concerning the Hereafter. Rather, they are in doubt about it. Rather, they are, concerning it, blind.
And those who disbelieve say, "When we have become dust as well as our forefathers, will we indeed be brought out [of the graves]?
We have been promised this, we and our forefathers, before. This is not but legends of the former peoples."
Say, [O Muhammad], "Travel through the land and observe how was the end of the criminals."
And grieve not over them or be in distress from what they conspire.
And they say, "When is [the fulfillment of] this promise, if you should be truthful?"
Say, "Perhaps it is close behind you - some of that for which you are impatient.
And indeed, your Lord is full of bounty for the people, but most of them do not show gratitude."
And indeed, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare.
And there is nothing concealed within the heaven and the earth except that it is in a clear Register.
Indeed, this Qur’an relates to the Children of Israel most of that over which they disagree.
And indeed, it is guidance and mercy for the believers.
Indeed, your Lord will judge between them by His [wise] judgement. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
So rely upon Allah; indeed, you are upon the clear truth.
Indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they have turned their backs retreating.
And you cannot guide the blind away from their error. You will only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they are Muslims [submitting to Allah].
And when the word befalls them, We will bring forth for them a creature from the earth speaking to them, [saying] that the people were, of Our verses, not certain [in faith].
And [warn of] the Day when We will gather from every nation a company of those who deny Our signs, and they will be [driven] in rows
Until, when they arrive [at the place of Judgement], He will say, "Did you deny My signs while you encompassed them not in knowledge, or what [was it that] you were doing?"
And the decree will befall them for the wrong they did, and they will not [be able to] speak.
Do they not see that We made the night that they may rest therein and the day giving sight? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
And [warn of] the Day the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be terrified except whom Allah wills. And all will come to Him humbled.
And you see the mountains, thinking them rigid, while they will pass as the passing of clouds. [It is] the work of Allah, who perfected all things. Indeed, He is Acquainted with that which you do.
Whoever comes [at Judgement] with a good deed will have better than it, and they, from the terror of that Day, will be safe.
And whoever comes with an evil deed - their faces will be overturned into the Fire, [and it will be said], "Are you recompensed except for what you used to do?"
[Say, O Muhammad], "I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city, who made it sacred and to whom [belongs] all things. And I am commanded to be of the Muslims [those who submit to Allah]
And to recite the Qur’an." And whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] himself; and whoever strays - say, "I am only [one] of the warners."
And say, "[All] praise is [due] to Allah. He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do."
Ta, Seen, Meem.
These are the verses of the clear Book.
We recite to you from the news of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for a people who believe.
Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters.
And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors
And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and [his minister] Haman and their soldiers through them that which they had feared.
And We inspired to the mother of Moses, "Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers."
And the family of Pharaoh picked him up [out of the river] so that he would become to them an enemy and a [cause of] grief. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers were deliberate sinners.
And the wife of Pharaoh said, "[He will be] a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not.
And the heart of Moses’ mother became empty [of all else]. She was about to disclose [the matter concerning] him had We not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers.
And she said to his sister, "Follow him"; so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not.
And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before, so she said, "Shall I direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his upbringing] sincere?"
So We restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of the people do not know.
And when he attained his full strength and was [mentally] mature, We bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good.
And he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people and found therein two men fighting: one from his faction and one from among his enemy. And the one from his faction called for help to him against the one from his enemy, so Moses struck him and [unintentionally] killed him. [Moses] said, "This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy."
He said, "My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me," and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
He said, "My Lord, for the favor You bestowed upon me, I will never be an assistant to the criminals."
And he became inside the city fearful and anticipating [exposure], when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day cried out to him [once again]. Moses said to him, "Indeed, you are an evident, [persistent] deviator."
And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he said, "O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders."
And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, "O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you [intending] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisors."
So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension]. He said, "My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people."
And when he directed himself toward Madyan, he said, "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the sound way."
And when he came to the well of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found aside from them two women driving back [their flocks]. He said, "What is your circumstance?" They said, "We do not water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man."
So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, "My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need."
Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, "Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us." So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, "Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people."
One of the women said, "O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy."
He said, "Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you. And I do not wish to put you in difficulty. You will find me, if Allah wills, from among the righteous."
[Moses] said, "That is [established] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete - there is no injustice to me, and Allah, over what we say, is Witness."
And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire. He said to his family, "Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there [some] information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves."
But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot - from the tree, "O Moses, indeed I am Allah, Lord of the worlds."
And [he was told], "Throw down your staff." But when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], "O Moses, approach and fear not. Indeed, you are of the secure.
Insert your hand into the opening of your garment; it will come out white, without disease. And draw in your arm close to you [as prevention] from fear, for those are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his establishment. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient."
He said, "My Lord, indeed, I killed from among them someone, and I fear they will kill me.
And my brother Aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so send him with me as support, verifying me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me."
[Allah] said, "We will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you. [It will be] through Our signs; you and those who follow you will be the predominant."
But when Moses came to them with Our signs as clear evidences, they said, "This is not except invented magic, and we have not heard of this [religion] among our forefathers."
And Moses said, "My Lord is more knowing [than we or you] of who has come with guidance from Him and to whom will be succession in the home. Indeed, wrongdoers do not succeed."
And Pharaoh said, "O eminent ones, I have not known you to have a god other than me. Then ignite for me, O Haman, [a fire] upon the clay and make for me a tower that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I do think he is among the liars."
And he was arrogant, he and his soldiers, in the land, without right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us.
So We took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea. So see how was the end of the wrongdoers.
And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped.
And We caused to overtake them in this world a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be of the despised.
And We gave Moses the Scripture, after We had destroyed the former generations, as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded.
And you, [O Muhammad], were not on the western side [of the mount] when We revealed to Moses the command, and you were not among the witnesses [to that].
But We produced [many] generations [after Moses], and prolonged was their duration. And you were not a resident among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our verses, but We were senders [of this message].
And you were not at the side of the mount when We called [Moses] but [were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded.
And if not that a disaster should strike them for what their hands put forth [of sins] and they would say, "Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses and been among the believers?"...
But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, "Why was he not given like that which was given to Moses?" Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Moses before? They said, "[They are but] two works of magic supporting each other, and indeed we are, in both, disbelievers."
Say, "Then bring a scripture from Allah which is more guiding than either of them that I may follow it, if you should be truthful."
But if they do not respond to you - then know that they only follow their [own] desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
And We have [repeatedly] conveyed to them the Qur’an that they might be reminded.
Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it - they are believers in it.
And when it is recited to them, they say, "We have believed in it; indeed, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were, [even] before it, Muslims [submitting to Allah]."
Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and [because] they avert evil through good, and from what We have provided them they spend.
And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, "For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. Peace will be upon you; we seek not the ignorant."
Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.
And they say, "If we were to follow the guidance with you, we would be swept from our land." Have we not established for them a safe sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from Us? But most of them do not know.
And how many a city have We destroyed that was insolent in its [way of] living, and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly. And it is We who were the inheritors.
And never would your Lord have destroyed the cities until He had sent to their mother a messenger reciting to them Our verses. And We would not destroy the cities except while their people were wrongdoers.
And whatever thing you [people] have been given - it is [only for] the enjoyment of worldly life and its adornment. And what is with Allah is better and more lasting; so will you not use reason?
Then is he whom We have promised a good promise which he will obtain like he for whom We provided enjoyment of worldly life [but] then he is, on the Day of Resurrection, among those presented [for punishment in Hell]?
And [warn of] the Day He will call them and say, "Where are My ‘partners’ which you used to claim?"
Those upon whom the word will have come into effect will say, "Our Lord, these are the ones we led to error. We led them to error just as we were in error. We declare our disassociation [from them] to You. They did not used to worship us."
And it will be said, "Invoke your ‘partners’ " and they will invoke them; but they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment. If only they had followed guidance!
And [mention] the Day He will call them and say, "What did you answer the messengers?"
But the information will be unapparent to them that Day, so they will not [be able to] ask one another.
But as for one who had repented, believed, and done righteousness, it is promised by Allah that he will be among the successful.
And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is Allah and high above what they associate with Him.
And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare.
And He is Allah; there is no deity except Him. To Him is [due all] praise in the first [life] and the Hereafter. And His is the [final] decision, and to Him you will be returned.
Say, "Have you considered: if Allah should make for you the night continuous until the Day of Resurrection, what deity other than Allah could bring you light? Then will you not hear?"
Say, "Have you considered: if Allah should make for you the day continuous until the Day of Resurrection, what deity other than Allah could bring you a night in which you may rest? Then will you not see?"
And out of His mercy He made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and [by day] seek from His bounty and [that] perhaps you will be grateful.
And [warn of] the Day He will call them and say, "Where are my ‘partners’ which you used to claim?"
And We will extract from every nation a witness and say, "Produce your proof," and they will know that the truth belongs to Allah, and lost from them is that which they used to invent.
Indeed, Qarun was from the people of Moses, but he tyrannized them. And We gave him of treasures whose keys would burden a band of strong men; thereupon his people said to him, "Do not exult. Indeed, Allah does not like the exultant.
But seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and [yet], do not forget your share of the world. And do good as Allah has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters."
He said, "I was only given it because of knowledge I have." Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him of generations those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumulation [of wealth]? But the criminals, about their sins, will not be asked.
So he came out before his people in his adornment. Those who desired the worldly life said, "Oh, would that we had like what was given to Qarun. Indeed, he is one of great fortune."
But those who had been given knowledge said, "Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for he who believes and does righteousness. And none are granted it except the patient."
And We caused the earth to swallow him and his home. And there was for him no company to aid him other than Allah, nor was he of those who [could] defend themselves.
And those who had wished for his position the previous day began to say, "Oh, how Allah extends provision to whom He wills of His servants and restricts it! If not that Allah had conferred favor on us, He would have caused it to swallow us. Oh, how the disbelievers do not succeed!"
That home of the Hereafter We assign to those who do not desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous.
Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed will have better than it; and whoever comes with an evil deed - then those who did evil deeds will not be recompensed except [as much as] what they used to do.
Indeed, [O Muhammad], He who imposed upon you the Qur’an will take you back to a place of return. Say, "My Lord is most knowing of who brings guidance and who is in clear error."
And you were not expecting that the Book would be conveyed to you, but [it is] a mercy from your Lord. So do not be an assistant to the disbelievers.
And never let them avert you from the verses of Allah after they have been revealed to you. And invite [people] to your Lord. And never be of those who associate others with Allah.
And do not invoke with Allah another deity. There is no deity except Him. Everything will be destroyed except His Face. His is the judgement, and to Him you will be returned.
Alif, Lam, Meem
Do the people think that they will be left to say, "We believe" and they will not be tried?
But We have certainly tried those before them, and Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars.
Or do those who do evil deeds think they can outrun Us? Evil is what they judge.
Whoever should hope for the meeting with Allah - indeed, the term decreed by Allah is coming. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And whoever strives only strives for [the benefit of] himself. Indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely remove from them their misdeeds and will surely reward them according to the best of what they used to do.
And We have enjoined upon man goodness to parents. But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. To Me is your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely admit them among the righteous [into Paradise].
And of the people are some who say, "We believe in Allah," but when one [of them] is harmed for [the cause of] Allah, they consider the trial of the people as [if it were] the punishment of Allah. But if victory comes from your Lord, they say, "Indeed, We were with you." Is not Allah most knowing of what is within the breasts of all creatures?
And Allah will surely make evident those who believe, and He will surely make evident the hypocrites.
And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Follow our way, and we will carry your sins." But they will not carry anything of their sins. Indeed, they are liars.
But they will surely carry their [own] burdens and [other] burdens along with their burdens, and they will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about what they used to invent.
And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers.
But We saved him and the companions of the ship, and We made it a sign for the worlds.
And [We sent] Abraham, when he said to his people, "Worship Allah and fear Him. That is best for you, if you should know.
You only worship, besides Allah, idols, and you produce a falsehood. Indeed, those you worship besides Allah do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So seek from Allah provision and worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you will be returned."
And if you [people] deny [the message] - already nations before you have denied. And there is not upon the Messenger except [the duty of] clear notification.
Have they not considered how Allah begins creation and then repeats it? Indeed that, for Allah, is easy.
Say, [O Muhammad], "Travel through the land and observe how He began creation. Then Allah will produce the final creation. Indeed Allah, over all things, is competent."
He punishes whom He wills and has mercy upon whom He wills, and to Him you will be returned.
And you will not cause failure [to Allah] upon the earth or in the heaven. And you have not other than Allah any protector or any helper.
And the ones who disbelieve in the signs of Allah and the meeting with Him - those have despaired of My mercy, and they will have a painful punishment.
And the answer of Abraham’s people was not but that they said, "Kill him or burn him," but Allah saved him from the fire. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
And [Abraham] said, "You have only taken, other than Allah, idols as [a bond of] affection among you in worldly life. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will deny one another and curse one another, and your refuge will be the Fire, and you will not have any helpers."
And Lot believed him. [Abraham] said, "Indeed, I will emigrate to [the service of] my Lord. Indeed, He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise."
And We gave to Him Isaac and Jacob and placed in his descendants prophethood and scripture. And We gave him his reward in this world, and indeed, he is in the Hereafter among the righteous.
And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, "Indeed, you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds.
Indeed, you approach men and obstruct the road and commit in your meetings [every] evil." And the answer of his people was not but they said, "Bring us the punishment of Allah, if you should be of the truthful."
He said, "My Lord, support me against the corrupting people."
And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings, they said, "Indeed, we will destroy the people of that Lot’s city. Indeed, its people have been wrongdoers."
[Abraham] said, "Indeed, within it is Lot." They said, "We are more knowing of who is within it. We will surely save him and his family, except his wife. She is to be of those who remain behind."
And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed for them and felt for them great discomfort. They said, "Fear not, nor grieve. Indeed, we will save you and your family, except your wife; she is to be of those who remain behind.
Indeed, we will bring down on the people of this city punishment from the sky because they have been defiantly disobedient."
And We have certainly left of it a sign as clear evidence for a people who use reason.
And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu‘ayb, and he said, "O my people, worship Allah and expect the Last Day and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption."
But they denied him, so the earthquake seized them, and they became within their home [corpses] fallen prone.
And [We destroyed] ‘Aad and Thamud, and it has become clear to you from their [ruined] dwellings. And Satan had made pleasing to them their deeds and averted them from the path, and they were endowed with perception.
And [We destroyed] Qarun and Pharaoh and Haman. And Moses had already come to them with clear evidences, and they were arrogant in the land, but they were not outrunners [of Our punishment].
So each We seized for his sin; and among them were those upon whom We sent a storm of stones, and among them were those who were seized by the blast [from the sky], and among them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow, and among them were those whom We drowned. And Allah would not have wronged them, but it was they who were wronging themselves.
The example of those who take allies other than Allah is like that of the spider who takes a home. And indeed, the weakest of homes is the home of the spider, if they only knew.
Indeed, Allah knows whatever thing they call upon other than Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
And these examples We present to the people, but none will understand them except those of knowledge.
Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth. Indeed in that is a sign for the believers.
Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do.
And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, "We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."
And thus We have sent down to you the Qur’an. And those to whom We [previously] gave the Scripture believe in it. And among these [people of Makkah] are those who believe in it. And none reject Our verses except the disbelievers.
And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand. Otherwise the falsifiers would have had [cause for] doubt.
Rather, the Qur’an is distinct verses [preserved] within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge. And none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers.
But they say, "Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, "The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner."
And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book which is recited to them? Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe.
Say, "Sufficient is Allah between me and you as Witness. He knows what is in the heavens and earth. And they who have believed in falsehood and disbelieved in Allah - it is those who are the losers."
And they urge you to hasten the punishment. And if not for [the decree of] a specified term, punishment would have reached them. But it will surely come to them suddenly while they perceive not.
They urge you to hasten the punishment. And indeed, Hell will be encompassing of the disbelievers
On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their feet and it is said, "Taste [the result of] what you used to do."
O My servants who have believed, indeed My earth is spacious, so worship only Me.
Every soul will taste death. Then to Us will you be returned.
And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - We will surely assign to them of Paradise [elevated] chambers beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers
Who have been patient and upon their Lord rely.
And how many a creature carries not its [own] provision. Allah provides for it and for you. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
If you asked them, "Who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and the moon?" they would surely say, "Allah." Then how are they deluded?
Allah extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts for him. Indeed Allah is, of all things, Knowing.
And if you asked them, "Who sends down rain from the sky and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness?" they would surely say "Allah." Say, "Praise to Allah"; but most of them do not reason.
And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement. And indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the [eternal] life, if only they knew.
And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him
So that they will deny what We have granted them, and they will enjoy themselves. But they are going to know.
Have they not seen that We made [Makkah] a safe sanctuary, while people are being taken away all around them? Then in falsehood do they believe, and in the favor of Allah they disbelieve?
And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a [sufficient] residence for the disbelievers?
And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.
Alif, Lam, Meem.
The Byzantines have been defeated
In the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will overcome.
Within three to nine years. To Allah belongs the command before and after. And that day the believers will rejoice
In the victory of Allah. He gives victory to whom He wills, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
[It is] the promise of Allah. Allah does not fail in His promise, but most of the people do not know.
They know what is apparent of the worldly life, but they, of the Hereafter, are unaware.
Do they not contemplate within themselves? Allah has not created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term. And indeed, many of the people, in [the matter of] the meeting with their Lord, are disbelievers.
Have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? They were greater than them in power, and they plowed the earth and built it up more than they have built it up, and their messengers came to them with clear evidences. And Allah would not ever have wronged them, but they were wronging themselves.
Then the end of those who did evil was the worst [consequence] because they denied the signs of Allah and used to ridicule them.
Allah begins creation; then He will repeat it; then to Him you will be returned.
And the Day the Hour appears the criminals will be in despair.
And there will not be for them among their [alleged] partners any intercessors, and they will [then] be disbelievers in their partners.
And the Day the Hour appears - that Day they will become separated.
And as for those who had believed and done righteous deeds, they will be in a garden [of Paradise], delighted.
But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our verses and the meeting of the Hereafter, those will be brought into the punishment [to remain].
So exalted is Allah when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning.
And to Him is [due all] praise throughout the heavens and the earth. And [exalted is He] at night and when you are at noon.
He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness. And thus will you be brought out.
And of His signs is that He created you from dust; then, suddenly you were human beings dispersing [throughout the earth].
And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.
And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.
And of His signs is your sleep by night and day and your seeking of His bounty. Indeed in that are signs for a people who listen.
And of His signs is [that] He shows you the lightening [causing] fear and aspiration, and He sends down rain from the sky by which He brings to life the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that are signs for a people who use reason.
And of His signs is that the heaven and earth remain by His command. Then when He calls you with a [single] call from the earth, immediately you will come forth.
And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and earth. All are to Him devoutly obedient.
And it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that is [even] easier for Him. To Him belongs the highest attribute in the heavens and earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
He presents to you an example from yourselves. Do you have among those whom your right hands possess any partners in what We have provided for you so that you are equal therein [and] would fear them as your fear of one another [within a partnership]? Thus do We detail the verses for a people who use reason.
But those who wrong follow their [own] desires without knowledge. Then who can guide one whom Allah has sent astray? And for them there are no helpers.
So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of Allah. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.
[Adhere to it], turning in repentance to Him, and fear Him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with Allah
[Or] of those who have divided their religion and become sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has.
And when adversity touches the people, they call upon their Lord, turning in repentance to Him. Then when He lets them taste mercy from Him, at once a party of them associate others with their Lord,
So that they will deny what We have granted them. Then enjoy yourselves, for you are going to know.
Or have We sent down to them an authority, and it speaks of what they were associating with Him?
And when We let the people taste mercy, they rejoice therein, but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have put forth, immediately they despair.
Do they not see that Allah extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]? Indeed, in that are signs for a people who believe.
So give the relative his right, as well as the needy and the traveler. That is best for those who desire the countenance of Allah, and it is they who will be the successful.
And whatever you give for interest to increase within the wealth of people will not increase with Allah. But what you give in zakah, desiring the countenance of Allah - those are the multipliers.
Allah is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, and then will give you life. Are there any of your "partners" who does anything of that? Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.
Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned so He may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].
Say, [O Muhammad], "Travel through the land and observe how was the end of those before. Most of them were associators [of others with Allah].
So direct your face toward the correct religion before a Day comes from Allah of which there is no repelling. That Day, they will be divided.
Whoever disbelieves - upon him is [the consequence of] his disbelief. And whoever does righteousness - they are for themselves preparing,
That He may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds out of His bounty. Indeed, He does not like the disbelievers.
And of His signs is that He sends the winds as bringers of good tidings and to let you taste His mercy and so the ships may sail at His command and so you may seek of His bounty, and perhaps you will be grateful.
And We have already sent messengers before you to their peoples, and they came to them with clear evidences; then We took retribution from those who committed crimes, and incumbent upon Us was support of the believers.
It is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however He wills, and He makes them fragments so you see the rain emerge from within them. And when He causes it to fall upon whom He wills of His servants, immediately they rejoice
Although they were, before it was sent down upon them - before that, in despair.
So observe the effects of the mercy of Allah - how He gives life to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed, that [same one] will give life to the dead, and He is over all things competent.
But if We should send a [bad] wind and they saw [their crops] turned yellow, they would remain thereafter disbelievers.
So indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs, retreating.
And you cannot guide the blind away from their error. You will only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they are Muslims [in submission to Allah].
Allah is the one who created you from weakness, then made after weakness strength, then made after strength weakness and white hair. He creates what He wills, and He is the Knowing, the Competent.
And the Day the Hour appears the criminals will swear they had remained but an hour. Thus they were deluded.
But those who were given knowledge and faith will say, "You remained the extent of Allah’s decree until the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not used to know."
So that Day, their excuse will not benefit those who wronged, nor will they be asked to appease [Allah].
And We have certainly presented to the people in this Qur’an from every [kind of] example. But, [O Muhammad], if you should bring them a sign, the disbelievers will surely say, "You [believers] are but falsifiers."
Thus does Allah seal the hearts of those who do not know.
So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And let them not disquiet you who are not certain [in faith].
Alif, Lam, Meem.
These are verses of the wise Book,
As guidance and mercy for the doers of good
Who establish prayer and give zakah, and they, of the Hereafter, are certain [in faith].
Those are on [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.
And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead [others] from the way of Allah without knowledge and who takes it in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment.
And when our verses are recited to him, he turns away arrogantly as if he had not heard them, as if there was in his ears deafness. So give him tidings of a painful punishment.
Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds - for them are the Gardens of Pleasure.
Wherein they abide eternally; [it is] the promise of Allah [which is] truth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
He created the heavens without pillars that you see and has cast into the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with you, and dispersed therein from every creature. And We sent down rain from the sky and made grow therein [plants] of every noble kind.
This is the creation of Allah. So show Me what those other than Him have created. Rather, the wrongdoers are in clear error.
And We had certainly given Luqman wisdom [and said], "Be grateful to Allah." And whoever is grateful is grateful for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever denies [His favor] - then indeed, Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy.
And [mention, O Muhammad], when Luqman said to his son while he was instructing him, "O my son, do not associate [anything] with Allah. Indeed, association [with him] is great injustice."
And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.
But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance]. Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do.
[And Luqman said], "O my son, indeed if wrong should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Acquainted.
O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination.
And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly. Indeed, Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful.
And be moderate in your pace and lower your voice; indeed, the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys."
Do you not see that Allah has made subject to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and amply bestowed upon you His favors, [both] apparent and unapparent? But of the people is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening Book [from Him].
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say, "Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers." Even if Satan was inviting them to the punishment of the Blaze?
And whoever submits his face to Allah while he is a doer of good - then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold. And to Allah will be the outcome of [all] matters.
And whoever has disbelieved - let not his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, and We will inform them of what they did. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts.
We grant them enjoyment for a little; then We will force them to a massive punishment.
And if you asked them, "Who created the heavens and earth?" they would surely say, "Allah." Say, "[All] praise is [due] to Allah"; but most of them do not know.
To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth. Indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.
And if whatever trees upon the earth were pens and the sea [was ink], replenished thereafter by seven [more] seas, the words of Allah would not be exhausted. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.
Your creation and your resurrection will not be but as that of a single soul. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing.
Do you not see that Allah causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term, and that Allah, with whatever you do, is Acquainted?
That is because Allah is the Truth, and that what they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the Most High, the Grand.
Do you not see that ships sail through the sea by the favor of Allah that He may show you of His signs? Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.
And when waves come over them like canopies, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, there are [some] of them who are moderate [in faith]. And none rejects Our signs except everyone treacherous and ungrateful.
O mankind, fear your Lord and fear a Day when no father will avail his son, nor will a son avail his father at all. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth, so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about Allah by the Deceiver.
Indeed, Allah [alone] has knowledge of the Hour and sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.
Alif, Lam, Meem.
[This is] the revelation of the Book about which there is no doubt from the Lord of the worlds.
Or do they say, "He invented it"? Rather, it is the truth from your Lord, [O Muhammad], that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you [so] perhaps they will be guided.
It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days; then He established Himself above the Throne. You have not besides Him any protector or any intercessor; so will you not be reminded?
He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to Him in a Day, the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count.
That is the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,
Who perfected everything which He created and began the creation of man from clay.
Then He made his posterity out of the extract of a liquid disdained.
Then He proportioned him and breathed into him from His [created] soul and made for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.
And they say, "When we are lost within the earth, will we indeed be [recreated] in a new creation?" Rather, they are, in [the matter of] the meeting with their Lord, disbelievers.
Say, "The angel of death will take you who has been entrusted with you. Then to your Lord you will be returned."
If you could but see when the criminals are hanging their heads before their Lord, [saying], "Our Lord, we have seen and heard, so return us [to the world]; we will work righteousness. Indeed, we are [now] certain."
And if we had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect [that] "I will surely fill Hell with jinn and people all together.
So taste [punishment] because you forgot the meeting of this, your Day; indeed, We have [accordingly] forgotten you. And taste the punishment of eternity for what you used to do."
Only those believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded by them, fall down in prostration and exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord, and they are not arrogant.
They arise from [their] beds; they supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We have provided them, they spend.
And no soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort for eyes as reward for what they used to do.
Then is one who was a believer like one who was defiantly disobedient? They are not equal.
As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, for them will be the Gardens of Refuge as accommodation for what they used to do.
But as for those who defiantly disobeyed, their refuge is the Fire. Every time they wish to emerge from it, they will be returned to it while it is said to them, "Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny."
And we will surely let them taste the nearer punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will repent.
And who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord; then he turns away from them? Indeed We, from the criminals, will take retribution.
And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so do not be in doubt over his meeting. And we made the Torah guidance for the Children of Israel.
And We made from among them leaders guiding by Our command when they were patient and [when] they were certain of Our signs.
Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.
Has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them, [as] they walk among their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs; then do they not hear?
Have they not seen that We drive the water [in clouds] to barren land and bring forth thereby crops from which their livestock eat and [they] themselves? Then do they not see?
And they say, "When will be this conquest, if you should be truthful?"
Say, [O Muhammad], "On the Day of Conquest the belief of those who had disbelieved will not benefit them, nor will they be reprieved."
So turn away from them and wait. Indeed, they are waiting.
O Prophet, fear Allah and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.
And follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord. Indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted.
And rely upon Allah; and sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.
Allah has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful your mothers. And he has not made your adopted sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but Allah says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.
Call them by [the names of] their fathers; it is more just in the sight of Allah. But if you do not know their fathers - then they are [still] your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you. And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
The Prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves, and his wives are [in the position of] their mothers. And those of [blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance] in the decree of Allah than the [other] believers and the emigrants, except that you may do to your close associates a kindness [through bequest]. That was in the Book inscribed.
And [mention, O Muhammad], when We took from the prophets their covenant and from you and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, the son of Mary; and We took from them a solemn covenant.
That He may question the truthful about their truth. And He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.
O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when armies came to [attack] you and We sent upon them a wind and armies [of angels] you did not see. And ever is Allah, of what you do, Seeing.
[Remember] when they came at you from above you and from below you, and when eyes shifted [in fear], and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah [various] assumptions.
There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking.
And [remember] when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said, "Allah and His Messenger did not promise us except delusion,"
And when a faction of them said, "O people of Yathrib, there is no stability for you [here], so return [home]." And a party of them asked permission of the Prophet, saying, "Indeed, our houses are unprotected," while they were not exposed. They did not intend except to flee.
And if they had been entered upon from all its [surrounding] regions and fitnah had been demanded of them, they would have done it and not hesitated over it except briefly.
And they had already promised Allah before not to turn their backs and flee. And ever is the promise to Allah [that about which one will be] questioned.
Say, [O Muhammad], "Never will fleeing benefit you if you should flee from death or killing; and then [if you did], you would not be given enjoyment [of life] except for a little."
Say, "Who is it that can protect you from Allah if He intends for you an ill or intends for you a mercy?" And they will not find for themselves besides Allah any protector or any helper.
Already Allah knows the hinderers among you and those [hypocrites] who say to their brothers, "Come to us," and do not go to battle, except for a few,
Indisposed toward you. And when fear comes, you see them looking at you, their eyes revolving like one being overcome by death. But when fear departs, they lash you with sharp tongues, indisposed toward [any] good. Those have not believed, so Allah has rendered their deeds worthless, and ever is that, for Allah, easy.
They think the companies have not [yet] withdrawn. And if the companies should come [again], they would wish they were in the desert among the bedouins, inquiring [from afar] about your news. And if they should be among you, they would not fight except for a little.
There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.
And when the believers saw the companies, they said, "This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth." And it increased them only in faith and acceptance.
Among the believers are men true to what they promised Allah. Among them is he who has fulfilled his vow [to the death], and among them is he who awaits [his chance]. And they did not alter [the terms of their commitment] by any alteration -
That Allah may reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if He wills or accept their repentance. Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful.
And Allah repelled those who disbelieved, in their rage, not having obtained any good. And sufficient was Allah for the believers in battle, and ever is Allah Powerful and Exalted in Might.
And He brought down those who supported them among the People of the Scripture from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts [so that] a party you killed, and you took captive a party.
And He caused you to inherit their land and their homes and their properties and a land which you have not trodden. And ever is Allah, over all things, competent.
O Prophet, say to your wives, "If you should desire the worldly life and its adornment, then come, I will provide for you and give you a gracious release.
But if you should desire Allah and His Messenger and the home of the Hereafter - then indeed, Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward."
O wives of the Prophet, whoever of you should commit a clear immorality - for her the punishment would be doubled two fold, and ever is that, for Allah, easy.
And whoever of you devoutly obeys Allah and His Messenger and does righteousness - We will give her her reward twice; and We have prepared for her a noble provision.
O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women. If you fear Allah, then do not be soft in speech [to men], lest he in whose heart is disease should covet, but speak with appropriate speech.
And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet's] household, and to purify you with [extensive] purification.
And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom. Indeed, Allah is ever Subtle and Acquainted [with all things].
Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.
It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.
And [remember, O Muhammad], when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor, "Keep your wife and fear Allah," while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished.
There is not to be upon the Prophet any discomfort concerning that which Allah has imposed upon him. [This is] the established way of Allah with those [prophets] who have passed on before. And ever is the command of Allah a destiny decreed.
[Allah praises] those who convey the messages of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.
Muhammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and last of the prophets. And ever is Allah, of all things, Knowing.
O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance
And exalt Him morning and afternoon.
It is He who confers blessing upon you, and His angels [ask Him to do so] that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light. And ever is He, to the believers, Merciful.
Their greeting the Day they meet Him will be, "Peace." And He has prepared for them a noble reward.
O Prophet, indeed We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner.
And one who invites to Allah, by His permission, and an illuminating lamp.
And give good tidings to the believers that they will have from Allah great bounty.
And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites but do not harm them, and rely upon Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.
O You who have believed, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them, then there is not for you any waiting period to count concerning them. So provide for them and give them a gracious release.
O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation and those your right hand possesses from what Allah has returned to you [of captives] and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet [and] if the Prophet wishes to marry her, [this is] only for you, excluding the [other] believers. We certainly know what We have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess, [but this is for you] in order that there will be upon you no discomfort. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
You, [O Muhammad], may put aside whom you will of them or take to yourself whom you will. And any that you desire of those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separated - there is no blame upon you [in returning her]. That is more suitable that they should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them - all of them. And Allah knows what is in your hearts. And ever is Allah Knowing and Forbearing.
Not lawful to you, [O Muhammad], are [any additional] women after [this], nor [is it] for you to exchange them for [other] wives, even if their beauty were to please you, except what your right hand possesses. And ever is Allah, over all things, an Observer.
O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not [conceivable or lawful] for you to harm the Messenger of Allah or to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that would be in the sight of Allah an enormity.
Whether you reveal a thing or conceal it, indeed Allah is ever, of all things, Knowing.
There is no blame upon women concerning their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or their sisters’ sons or their women or those their right hands possess. And fear Allah. Indeed Allah is ever, over all things, Witness.
Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace.
Indeed, those who abuse Allah and His Messenger - Allah has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment.
And those who harm believing men and believing women for [something] other than what they have earned have certainly born upon themselves a slander and manifest sin.
O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and those who spread rumors in al-Madinah do not cease, We will surely incite you against them; then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little.
Accursed wherever they are found, [being] seized and massacred completely.
[This is] the established way of Allah with those who passed on before; and you will not find in the way of Allah any change.
People ask you concerning the Hour. Say," Knowledge of it is only with Allah. And what may make you perceive? Perhaps the Hour is near."
Indeed, Allah has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a Blaze.
Abiding therein forever, they will not find a protector or a helper.
The Day their faces will be turned about in the Fire, they will say, "How we wish we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger."
And they will say, "Our Lord, indeed we obeyed our masters and our dignitaries, and they led us astray from the [right] way.
Our Lord, give them double the punishment and curse them with a great curse."
O you who have believed, be not like those who abused Moses; then Allah cleared him of what they said. And he, in the sight of Allah, was distinguished.
O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice.
He will [then] amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment.
Indeed, we offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man [undertook to] bear it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant.
[It was] so that Allah may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the men and women who associate others with Him and that Allah may accept repentance from the believing men and believing women. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
[All] praise is [due] to Allah, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Him belongs [all] praise in the Hereafter. And He is the Wise, the Acquainted.
He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein. And He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.
But those who disbelieve say, "The Hour will not come to us." Say, "Yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you. [Allah is] the Knower of the unseen." Not absent from Him is an atom's weight within the heavens or within the earth or [what is] smaller than that or greater, except that it is in a clear register -
That He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. Those will have forgiveness and noble provision.
But those who strive against Our verses [seeking] to cause failure - for them will be a painful punishment of foul nature.
And those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and it guides to the path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy.
But those who disbelieve say, "Shall we direct you to a man who will inform you [that] when you have disintegrated in complete disintegration, you will [then] be [recreated] in a new creation?
Has he invented about Allah a lie or is there in him madness?" Rather, they who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in the punishment and [are in] extreme error.
Then, do they not look at what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth? If We should will, We could cause the earth to swallow them or [could] let fall upon them fragments from the sky. Indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back [to Allah].
And We certainly gave David from Us bounty. [We said], "O mountains, repeat [Our] praises with him, and the birds [as well]." And We made pliable for him iron,
[Commanding him], "Make full coats of mail and calculate [precisely] the links, and work [all of you] righteousness. Indeed I, of what you do, am Seeing."
And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind - its morning [journey was that of] a month - and its afternoon [journey was that of] a month, and We made flow for him a spring of [liquid] copper. And among the jinn were those who worked for him by the permission of his Lord. And whoever deviated among them from Our command - We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blaze.
They made for him what he willed of elevated chambers, statues, bowls like reservoirs, and stationary kettles. [We said], "Work, O family of David, in gratitude." And few of My servants are grateful.
And when We decreed for Solomon death, nothing indicated to the jinn his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff. But when he fell, it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment.
There was for [the tribe of] Saba’ in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left. [They were told], "Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord."
But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam, and We replaced their two [fields of] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees.
[By] that We repaid them because they disbelieved. And do We [thus] repay except the ungrateful?
And We placed between them and the cities which We had blessed [many] visible cities. And We determined between them the [distances of] journey, [saying], "Travel between them by night or day in safety."
But [insolently] they said, "Our Lord, lengthen the distance between our journeys," and wronged themselves, so We made them narrations and dispersed them in total dispersion. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.
And Iblees had already confirmed through them his assumption, so they followed him, except for a party of believers.
And he had over them no authority except [it was decreed] that We might make evident who believes in the Hereafter from who is thereof in doubt. And your Lord, over all things, is Guardian.
Say, [O Muhammad], "Invoke those you claim [as deities] besides Allah." They do not possess an atom's weight [of ability] in the heavens or on the earth, and they do not have therein any partnership [with Him], nor is there for Him from among them any assistant.
And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits. [And those wait] until, when terror is removed from their hearts, they will say [to one another], "What has your Lord said?" They will say, "The truth." And He is the Most High, the Grand.
Say, "Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?" Say, "Allah. And indeed, we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error."
Say, "You will not be asked about what we committed, and we will not be asked about what you do."
Say, "Our Lord will bring us together; then He will judge between us in truth. And He is the Knowing Judge."
Say, "Show me those whom you have attached to Him as partners. No! Rather, He [alone] is Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."
And We have not sent you except comprehensively to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. But most of the people do not know.
And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"
Say, "For you is the appointment of a Day [when] you will not remain thereafter an hour, nor will you precede [it]."
And those who disbelieve say, "We will never believe in this Qur’an nor in that before it." But if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, refuting each other's words... Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, "If not for you, we would have been believers."
Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed, "Did we avert you from guidance after it had come to you? Rather, you were criminals."
Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, "Rather, [it was your] conspiracy of night and day when you were ordering us to disbelieve in Allah and attribute to Him equals." But they will [all] confide regret when they see the punishment; and We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be recompensed except for what they used to do?
And We did not send into a city any warner except that its affluent said, "Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers."
And they said, "We are more [than the believers] in wealth and children, and we are not to be punished."
Say, "Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it], but most of the people do not know."
And it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to Us in position, but it is [by being] one who has believed and done righteousness. For them there will be the double reward for what they did, and they will be in the upper chambers [of Paradise], safe [and secure].
And the ones who strive against Our verses to cause [them] failure - those will be brought into the punishment [to remain].
Say, "Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts [it] for him. But whatever thing you spend [in His cause] - He will compensate it; and He is the best of providers."
And [mention] the Day when He will gather them all and then say to the angels, "Did these [people] used to worship you?"
They will say, "Exalted are You! You, [O Allah], are our benefactor not them. Rather, they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them."
But today you do not hold for one another [the power of] benefit or harm, and We will say to those who wronged, "Taste the punishment of the Fire, which you used to deny."
And when our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, they say, "This is not but a man who wishes to avert you from that which your fathers were worshipping." And they say, "This is not except a lie invented." And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, "This is not but obvious magic."
And We had not given them any scriptures which they could study, and We had not sent to them before you, [O Muhammad], any warner.
And those before them denied, and the people of Makkah have not attained a tenth of what We had given them. But the former peoples denied My messengers, so how [terrible] was My reproach.
Say, "I only advise you of one [thing] - that you stand for Allah, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought." There is not in your companion any madness. He is only a warner to you before a severe punishment.
Say, "Whatever payment I might have asked of you - it is yours. My payment is only from Allah, and He is, over all things, Witness."
Say, "Indeed, my Lord projects the truth. Knower of the unseen."
Say, "The truth has come, and falsehood can neither begin [anything] nor repeat [it]."
Say, "If I should err, I would only err against myself. But if I am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me. Indeed, He is Hearing and near."
And if you could see when they are terrified but there is no escape, and they will be seized from a place nearby.
And they will [then] say, "We believe in it!" But how for them will be the taking [of faith] from a place far away?
And they had already disbelieved in it before and would assault the unseen from a place far away.
And prevention will be placed between them and what they desire, as was done with their kind before. Indeed, they were in disquieting denial.
[All] praise is [due] to Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, [who] made the angels messengers having wings, two or three or four. He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.
Whatever Allah grants to people of mercy - none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds - none can release it thereafter. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
O mankind, remember the favor of Allah upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded?
And if they deny you, [O Muhammad] - already were messengers denied before you. And to Allah are returned [all] matters.
O mankind, indeed the promise of Allah is truth, so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about Allah by the Deceiver.
Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze.
Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment, and those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and great reward.
Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]? For indeed, Allah sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.
And it is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Thus is the resurrection.
Whoever desires honor [through power] - then to Allah belongs all honor. To Him ascends good speech, and righteous work raises it. But they who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment, and the plotting of those - it will perish.
And Allah created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop; then He made you mates. And no female conceives nor does she give birth except with His knowledge. And no aged person is granted [additional] life nor is his lifespan lessened but that it is in a register. Indeed, that for Allah is easy.
And not alike are the two bodies of water. One is fresh and sweet, palatable for drinking, and one is salty and bitter. And from each you eat tender meat and extract ornaments which you wear, and you see the ships plowing through [them] that you might seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be grateful.
He causes the night to enter the day, and He causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon - each running [its course] for a specified term. That is Allah, your Lord; to Him belongs sovereignty. And those whom you invoke other than Him do not possess [as much as] the membrane of a date seed.
If you invoke them, they do not hear your supplication; and if they heard, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your association. And none can inform you like [one] Acquainted [with all matters].
O mankind, you are those in need of Allah, while Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.
If He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation.
And that is for Allah not difficult.
And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and have established prayer. And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for [the benefit of] his soul. And to Allah is the [final] destination.
Not equal are the blind and the seeing,
Nor are the darknesses and the light,
Nor are the shade and the heat,
And not equal are the living and the dead. Indeed, Allah causes to hear whom He wills, but you cannot make hear those in the graves.
You, [O Muhammad], are not but a warner.
Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner.
And if they deny you - then already have those before them denied. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and written ordinances and with the enlightening Scripture.
Then I seized the ones who disbelieved, and how [terrible] was My reproach.
Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby fruits of varying colors? And in the mountains are tracts, white and red of varying shades and [some] extremely black.
And among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly. Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Forgiving.
Indeed, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish prayer and spend [in His cause] out of what We have provided them, secretly and publicly, [can] expect a profit that will never perish -
That He may give them in full their rewards and increase for them of His bounty. Indeed, He is Forgiving and Appreciative.
And that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], of the Book is the truth, confirming what was before it. Indeed, Allah, of His servants, is Acquainted and Seeing.
Then we caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of Our servants; and among them is he who wrongs himself, and among them is he who is moderate, and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of Allah. That [inheritance] is what is the great bounty.
[For them are] gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments therein will be silk.
And they will say, "Praise to Allah, who has removed from us [all] sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative -
He who has settled us in the home of duration out of His bounty. There touches us not in it any fatigue, and there touches us not in it weariness [of mind]."
And for those who disbelieve will be the fire of Hell. [Death] is not decreed for them so they may die, nor will its torment be lightened for them. Thus do we recompense every ungrateful one.
And they will cry out therein, "Our Lord, remove us; we will do righteousness - other than what we were doing!" But did We not grant you life enough for whoever would remember therein to remember, and the warner had come to you? So taste [the punishment], for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper.
Indeed, Allah is Knower of the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and earth. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
It is He who has made you successors upon the earth. And whoever disbelieves - upon him will be [the consequence of] his disbelief. And the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their Lord except in hatred; and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except in loss.
Say, "Have you considered your 'partners' whom you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created from the earth, or have they partnership [with Him] in the heavens? Or have We given them a book so they are [standing] on evidence therefrom? [No], rather, the wrongdoers do not promise each other except delusion."
Indeed, Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease. And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after Him. Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving.
And they swore by Allah their strongest oaths that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than [any] one of the [previous] nations. But when a warner came to them, it did not increase them except in aversion.
[Due to] arrogance in the land and plotting of evil; but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people. Then do they await except the way of the former peoples? But you will never find in the way of Allah any change, and you will never find in the way of Allah any alteration.
Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? And they were greater than them in power. But Allah is not to be caused failure by anything in the heavens or on the earth. Indeed, He is ever Knowing and Competent.
And if Allah were to impose blame on the people for what they have earned, He would not leave upon the earth any creature. But He defers them for a specified term. And when their time comes, then indeed Allah has ever been, of His servants, Seeing.
Ya, Seen.
By the wise Qur’an.
Indeed you, [O Muhammad], are from among the messengers,
On a straight path.
[This is] a revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,
That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.
Already the word has come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe.
Indeed, We have put shackles on their necks, and they are to their chins, so they are with heads [kept] aloft.
And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see.
And it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.
You can only warn one who follows the message and fears the Most Merciful unseen. So give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward.
Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind, and all things We have enumerated in a clear register.
And present to them an example: the people of the city, when the messengers came to it -
When We sent to them two but they denied them, so We strengthened them with a third, and they said, "Indeed, we are messengers to you."
They said, "You are not but human beings like us, and the Most Merciful has not revealed a thing. You are only telling lies."
They said, "Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you,
And we are not responsible except for clear notification."
They said, "Indeed, we consider you a bad omen. If you do not desist, we will surely stone you, and there will surely touch you, from us, a painful punishment."
They said, "Your omen is with yourselves. Is it because you were reminded? Rather, you are a transgressing people."
And there came from the farthest end of the city a man, running. He said, "O my people, follow the messengers.
Follow those who do not ask of you [any] payment, and they are [rightly] guided.
And why should I not worship He who created me and to whom you will be returned?
Should I take other than Him [false] deities [while], if the Most Merciful intends for me some adversity, their intercession will not avail me at all, nor can they save me?
Indeed, I would then be in manifest error.
Indeed, I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me."
It was said, "Enter Paradise." He said, "I wish my people could know
Of how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honored."
And We did not send down upon his people after him any soldiers from the heaven, nor would We have done so.
It was not but one shout, and immediately they were extinguished. 
How regretful for the servants. There did not come to them any messenger except that they used to ridicule him.
Have they not considered how many generations We destroyed before them - that they to them will not return?
And indeed, all of them will yet be brought present before Us.
And a sign for them is the dead earth. We have brought it to life and brought forth from it grain, and from it they eat.
And We placed therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines and caused to burst forth therefrom some springs -
That they may eat of His fruit. And their hands have not produced it, so will they not be grateful?
Exalted is He who created all pairs - from what the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know.
And a sign for them is the night. We remove from it [the light of] day, so they are [left] in darkness.
And the sun runs [on course] toward its stopping point. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
And the moon - We have determined for it phases, until it returns [appearing] like the old date stalk.
It is not allowable for the sun to reach the moon, nor does the night overtake the day, but each, in an orbit, is swimming.
And a sign for them is that We carried their forefathers in a laden ship.
And We created for them from the likes of it that which they ride.
And if We should will, We could drown them; then no one responding to a cry would there be for them, nor would they be saved
Except as a mercy from Us and provision for a time.
But when it is said to them, "Beware of what is before you and what is behind you; perhaps you will receive mercy..."
And no sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord except that they are from it turning away.
And when it is said to them, "Spend from that which Allah has provided for you," those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Should we feed one whom, if Allah had willed, He would have fed? You are not but in clear error."
And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"
They do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing.
And they will not be able [to give] any instruction, nor to their people can they return.
And the Horn will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten.
They will say, "O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping place?" [The reply will be], "This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth."
It will not be but one blast, and at once they are all brought present before Us.
So today no soul will be wronged at all, and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do.
Indeed the companions of Paradise, that Day, will be amused in [joyful] occupation -
They and their spouses - in shade, reclining on adorned couches.
For them therein is fruit, and for them is whatever they request [or wish]
[And] "Peace," a word from a Merciful Lord.
[Then He will say], "But stand apart today, you criminals.
Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy -
And that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path.
And he had already led astray from among you much of creation, so did you not use reason?
This is the Hellfire which you were promised.
[Enter to] burn therein today for what you used to deny."
That Day, We will seal over their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to earn.
And if We willed, We could have obliterated their eyes, and they would race to [find] the path, and how could they see?
And if We willed, We could have deformed them, [paralyzing them] in their places so they would not be able to proceed, nor could they return.
And he to whom We grant long life We reverse in creation; so will they not understand?
And We did not give Prophet Muhammad, knowledge of poetry, nor is it befitting for him. It is not but a message and a clear Qur’an
To warn whoever is alive and justify the word against the disbelievers.
Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our hands have made, grazing livestock, and [then] they are their owners?
And We have tamed them for them, so some of them they ride, and some of them they eat.
And for them therein are [other] benefits and drinks, so will they not be grateful?
But they have taken besides Allah [false] deities that perhaps they would be helped.
They are not able to help them, and they [themselves] are for them soldiers in attendance.
So let not their speech grieve you. Indeed, We know what they conceal and what they declare.
Does man not consider that We created him from a [mere] sperm-drop - then at once he is a clear adversary?
And he presents for Us an example and forgets his [own] creation. He says, "Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?"
Say, "He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing."
[It is] He who made for you from the green tree, fire, and then from it you ignite.
Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them? Yes, [it is so]; and He is the Knowing Creator.
His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, "Be," and it is.
So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.
By those [angels] lined up in rows
And those who drive [the clouds]
And those who recite the message,
Indeed, your God is One,
Lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them and Lord of the sunrises.
Indeed, We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars
And as protection against every rebellious devil
[So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side,
Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment,
Except one who snatches [some words] by theft, but they are pursued by a burning flame, piercing [in brightness].
Then inquire of them, [O Muhammad], "Are they a stronger [or more difficult] creation or those [others] We have created?" Indeed, We created men from sticky clay.
But you wonder, while they mock,
And when they are reminded, they remember not.
And when they see a sign, they ridicule
And say, "This is not but obvious magic.
When we have died and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected?
And our forefathers [as well]?"
Say, "Yes, and you will be [rendered] contemptible."
It will be only one shout, and at once they will be observing.
They will say, "O woe to us! This is the Day of Recompense."
[They will be told], "This is the Day of Judgement which you used to deny."
[The angels will be ordered], "Gather those who committed wrong, their kinds, and what they used to worship
Other than Allah, and guide them to the path of Hellfire
And stop them; indeed, they are to be questioned."
[They will be asked], "What is [wrong] with you? Why do you not help each other?"
But they, that Day, are in surrender.
And they will approach one another blaming each other.
They will say, "Indeed, you used to come at us from the right."
The oppressors will say, "Rather, you [yourselves] were not believers,
And we had over you no authority, but you were a transgressing people.
So the word of our Lord has come into effect upon us; indeed, we will taste [punishment].
And we led you to deviation; indeed, we were deviators."
So indeed they, that Day, will be sharing in the punishment.
Indeed, that is how We deal with the criminals.
Indeed they, when it was said to them, "There is no deity but Allah," were arrogant
And were saying, "Are we to leave our gods for a mad poet?"
Rather, the Prophet has come with the truth and confirmed the [previous] messengers.
Indeed, you [disbelievers] will be tasters of the painful punishment,
And you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do -
But not the chosen servants of Allah.
Those will have a provision determined -
Fruits; and they will be honored
In gardens of pleasure
On thrones facing one another.
There will be circulated among them a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring,
White and delicious to the drinkers;
No bad effect is there in it, nor from it will they be intoxicated.
And with them will be women limiting [their] glances, with large, [beautiful] eyes,
As if they were [delicate] eggs, well-protected.
And they will approach one another, inquiring of each other.
A speaker among them will say, "Indeed, I had a companion [on earth]
Who would say, 'Are you indeed of those who believe
That when we have died and become dust and bones, we will indeed be recompensed?’"
He will say, "Would you [care to] look?"
And he will look and see him in the midst of the Hellfire.
He will say, "By Allah, you almost ruined me.
If not for the favor of my Lord, I would have been of those brought in [to Hell].
Then, are we not to die
Except for our first death, and we will not be punished?"
Indeed, this is the great attainment.
For the like of this let the workers [on earth] work.
Is Paradise a better accommodation or the tree of zaqqum?
Indeed, We have made it a torment for the wrongdoers.
Indeed, it is a tree issuing from the bottom of the Hellfire,
Its emerging fruit as if it was heads of the devils.
And indeed, they will eat from it and fill with it their bellies.
Then indeed, they will have after it a mixture of scalding water.
Then indeed, their return will be to the Hellfire.
Indeed they found their fathers astray.
So they hastened [to follow] in their footsteps.
And there had already strayed before them most of the former peoples,
And We had already sent among them warners.
Then look how was the end of those who were warned -
But not the chosen servants of Allah.
And Noah had certainly called Us, and [We are] the best of responders.
And We saved him and his family from the great affliction.
And We made his descendants those remaining [on the earth]
And left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:
"Peace upon Noah among the worlds."
Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.
Then We drowned the disbelievers.
And indeed, among his kind was Abraham,
When he came to his Lord with a sound heart
[And] when he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?
Is it falsehood [as] gods other than Allah you desire?
Then what is your thought about the Lord of the worlds?"
And he cast a look at the stars
And said, "Indeed, I am [about to be] ill."
So they turned away from him, departing.
Then he turned to their gods and said, "Do you not eat?
What is [wrong] with you that you do not speak?"
And he turned upon them a blow with [his] right hand.
Then the people came toward him, hastening.
He said, "Do you worship that which you [yourselves] carve,
While Allah created you and that which you do?"
They said, "Construct for him a furnace and throw him into the burning fire."
And they intended for him a plan, but We made them the most debased.
And [then] he said, "Indeed, I will go to [where I am ordered by] my Lord; He will guide me.
My Lord, grant me [a child] from among the righteous."
So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy.
And when he reached with him [the age of] exertion, he said, "O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I [must] sacrifice you, so see what you think." He said, "O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast."
And when they had both submitted and he put him down upon his forehead,
We called to him, "O Abraham,
You have fulfilled the vision." Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
Indeed, this was the clear trial.
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice,
And We left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:
"Peace upon Abraham."
Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.
And We gave him good tidings of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous.
And We blessed him and Isaac. But among their descendants is the doer of good and the clearly unjust to himself.
And We did certainly confer favor upon Moses and Aaron.
And We saved them and their people from the great affliction,
And We supported them so it was they who overcame.
And We gave them the explicit Scripture,
And We guided them on the straight path.
And We left for them [favorable mention] among later generations:
"Peace upon Moses and Aaron."
Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
Indeed, they were of Our believing servants.
And indeed, Elias was from among the messengers,
When he said to his people, "Will you not fear Allah?
Do you call upon Ba‘l and leave the best of creators -
Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers?"
And they denied him, so indeed, they will be brought [for punishment],
Except the chosen servants of Allah.
And We left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:
"Peace upon Elias."
Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.
And indeed, Lot was among the messengers.
[So mention] when We saved him and his family, all,
Except his wife among those who remained [with the evildoers].
Then We destroyed the others.
And indeed, you pass by them in the morning
And at night. Then will you not use reason?
And indeed, Jonah was among the messengers.
[Mention] when he ran away to the laden ship.
And he drew lots and was among the losers.
Then the fish swallowed him, while he was blameworthy.
And had he not been of those who exalt Allah,
He would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are resurrected.
But We threw him onto the open shore while he was ill.
And We caused to grow over him a gourd vine.
And We sent him to [his people of] a hundred thousand or more.
And they believed, so We gave them enjoyment [of life] for a time.
So inquire of them, [O Muhammad], "Does your Lord have daughters while they have sons?
Or did We create the angels as females while they were witnesses?"
Unquestionably, it is out of their [invented] falsehood that they say,
"Allah has begotten," and indeed, they are liars.
Has He chosen daughters over sons?
What is [wrong] with you? How do you make judgement?
Then will you not be reminded?
Or do you have a clear authority?
Then produce your scripture, if you should be truthful.
And they have claimed between Him and the jinn a lineage, but the jinn have already known that they [who made such claims] will be brought to [punishment].
Exalted is Allah above what they describe,
Except the chosen servants of Allah [who do not share in that sin].
So indeed, you [disbelievers] and whatever you worship,
You cannot tempt [anyone] away from Him
Except he who is to [enter and] burn in the Hellfire.
[The angels say], "There is not among us any except that he has a known position.
And indeed, we are those who line up [for prayer].
And indeed, we are those who exalt Allah."
And indeed, the disbelievers used to say,
"If we had a message from [those of] the former peoples,
We would have been the chosen servants of Allah."
But they disbelieved in it, so they are going to know.
And Our word has already preceded for Our servants, the messengers,
[That] indeed, they would be those given victory
And [that] indeed, Our soldiers will be those who overcome.
So, [O Muhammad], leave them for a time.
And see [what will befall] them, for they are going to see.
Then for Our punishment are they impatient?
But when it descends in their territory, then evil is the morning of those who were warned.
And leave them for a time.
And see, for they are going to see.
Exalted is your Lord, the Lord of might, above what they describe.
And peace upon the messengers.
And praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds.
Sad. By the Qur’an containing reminder...
But those who disbelieve are in pride and dissension.
How many a generation have We destroyed before them, and they [then] called out; but it was not a time for escape.
And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, "This is a magician and a liar.
Has he made the gods [only] one God? Indeed, this is a curious thing."
And the eminent among them went forth, [saying], "Continue, and be patient over [the defense of] your gods. Indeed, this is a thing intended.
We have not heard of this in the latest religion. This is not but a fabrication.
Has the message been revealed to him out of [all of] us?" Rather, they are in doubt about My message. Rather, they have not yet tasted My punishment.
Or do they have the depositories of the mercy of your Lord, the Exalted in Might, the Bestower?
Or is theirs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? Then let them ascend through [any] ways of access.
[They are but] soldiers [who will be] defeated there among the companies [of disbelievers].
The people of Noah denied before them, and [the tribe of] ‘Aad and Pharaoh, the owner of stakes,
And [the tribe of] Thamud and the people of Lot and the companions of the thicket. Those are the companies.
Each of them denied the messengers, so My penalty was justified.
And these [disbelievers] await not but one blast [of the Horn]; for it there will be no delay.
And they say, "Our Lord, hasten for us our share [of the punishment] before the Day of Account"
Be patient over what they say and remember Our servant, David, the possessor of strength; indeed, he was one who repeatedly turned back [to Allah].
Indeed, We subjected the mountains [to praise] with him, exalting [Allah] in the [late] afternoon and [after] sunrise.
And the birds were assembled, all with him repeating [praises].
And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and discernment in speech.
And has there come to you the news of the adversaries, when they climbed over the wall of [his] prayer chamber -
When they entered upon David and he was alarmed by them? They said, "Fear not. [We are] two adversaries, one of whom has wronged the other, so judge between us with truth and do not exceed [it] and guide us to the sound path.
Indeed this, my brother, has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe; so he said, 'Entrust her to me,' and he overpowered me in speech."
[David] said, "He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - and few are they." And David became certain that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in repentance [to Allah].
So We forgave him that; and indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a good place of return.
[We said], "O David, indeed We have made you a successor upon the earth, so judge between the people in truth and do not follow [your own] desire, as it will lead you astray from the way of Allah." Indeed, those who go astray from the way of Allah will have a severe punishment for having forgotten the Day of Account.
And We did not create the heaven and the earth and that between them aimlessly. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire.
Or should we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters in the land? Or should We treat those who fear Allah like the wicked?
[This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded.
And to David We gave Solomon. An excellent servant, indeed he was one repeatedly turning back [to Allah].
[Mention] when there were exhibited before him in the afternoon the poised [standing] racehorses.
And he said, "Indeed, I gave preference to the love of good [things] over the remembrance of my Lord until the sun disappeared into the curtain [of darkness]."
[He said], "Return them to me," and set about striking [their] legs and necks.
And We certainly tried Solomon and placed on his throne a body; then he returned.
He said, "My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me. Indeed, You are the Bestower."
So We subjected to him the wind blowing by his command, gently, wherever he directed,
And [also] the devils [of jinn] - every builder and diver
And others bound together in shackles.
[We said], "This is Our gift, so grant or withhold without account."
And indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a good place of return.
And remember Our servant Job, when he called to his Lord, "Indeed, Satan has touched me with hardship and torment."
[So he was told], "Strike [the ground] with your foot; this is a [spring for] a cool bath and drink."
And We granted him his family and a like [number] with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for those of understanding.
[We said], "And take in your hand a bunch [of grass] and strike with it and do not break your oath." Indeed, We found him patient, an excellent servant. Indeed, he was one repeatedly turning back [to Allah].
And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - those of strength and [religious] vision.
Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [of the Hereafter].
And indeed they are, to Us, among the chosen and outstanding.
And remember Ishmael, Elisha and Dhul-Kifl, and all are among the outstanding.
This is a reminder. And indeed, for the righteous is a good place of return
Gardens of perpetual residence, whose doors will be opened to them.
Reclining within them, they will call therein for abundant fruit and drink.
And with them will be women limiting [their] glances and of equal age.
This is what you, [the righteous], are promised for the Day of Account.
Indeed, this is Our provision; for it there is no depletion.
This [is so]. But indeed, for the transgressors is an evil place of return -
Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the resting place.
This - so let them taste it - is scalding water and [foul] purulence.
And other [punishments] of its type [in various] kinds.
[Its inhabitants will say], "This is a company bursting in with you. No welcome for them. Indeed, they will burn in the Fire."
They will say, "Nor you! No welcome for you. You, [our leaders], brought this upon us, and wretched is the settlement."
They will say, "Our Lord, whoever brought this upon us - increase for him double punishment in the Fire."
And they will say, "Why do we not see men whom we used to count among the worst?
Is it [because] we took them in ridicule, or has [our] vision turned away from them?"
Indeed, that is truth - the quarreling of the people of the Fire.
Say, [O Muhammad], "I am only a warner, and there is not any deity except Allah, the One, the Prevailing.
Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver."
Say, "It is great news
From which you turn away.
I had no knowledge of the exalted assembly [of angels] when they were disputing [the creation of Adam].
It has not been revealed to me except that I am a clear warner."
[So mention] when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I am going to create a human being from clay.
So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration."
So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely.
Except Iblees; he was arrogant and became among the disbelievers.
[Allah] said, "O Iblees, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands? Were you arrogant [then], or were you [already] among the haughty?"
He said, "I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay."
[Allah] said, "Then get out of Paradise, for indeed, you are expelled.
And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Recompense."
He said, "My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected."
[Allah] said, "So indeed, you are of those reprieved
Until the Day of the time well-known."
[Iblees] said, "By your might, I will surely mislead them all
Except, among them, Your chosen servants."
[Allah] said, "The truth [is My oath], and the truth I say -
[That] I will surely fill Hell with you and those of them that follow you all together."
Say, [O Muhammad], "I do not ask you for the Qur’an any payment, and I am not of the pretentious
It is but a reminder to the worlds.
And you will surely know [the truth of] its information after a time."
The revelation of the Qur’an is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book, [O Muhammad], in truth. So worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion.
Unquestionably, for Allah is the pure religion. And those who take protectors besides Him [say], "We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in position." Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that over which they differ. Indeed, Allah does not guide he who is a liar and [confirmed] disbeliever.
If Allah had intended to take a son, He could have chosen from what He creates whatever He willed. Exalted is He; He is Allah, the One, the Prevailing.
He created the heavens and earth in truth. He wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term. Unquestionably, He is the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver.
He created you from one soul. Then He made from it its mate, and He produced for you from the grazing livestock eight mates. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, within three darknesses. That is Allah, your Lord; to Him belongs dominion. There is no deity except Him, so how are you averted?
If you disbelieve - indeed, Allah is Free from need of you. And He does not approve for His servants disbelief. And if you are grateful, He approves it for you; and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
And when adversity touches man, he calls upon his Lord, turning to Him [alone]; then when He bestows on him a favor from Himself, he forgets Him whom he called upon before, and he attributes to Allah equals to mislead [people] from His way. Say, "Enjoy your disbelief for a little; indeed, you are of the companions of the Fire."
Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, "Are those who know equal to those who do not know?" Only they will remember [who are] people of understanding.
Say, "O My servants who have believed, fear your Lord. For those who do good in this world is good, and the earth of Allah is spacious. Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account."
Say, [O Muhammad], "Indeed, I have been commanded to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion.
And I have been commanded to be the first [among you] of the Muslims."
Say, "Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day."
Say, "Allah [alone] do I worship, sincere to Him in my religion,
So worship what you will besides Him." Say, "Indeed, the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, that is the manifest loss."
They will have canopies of fire above them and below them, canopies. By that Allah threatens His servants. O My servants, then fear Me.
But those who have avoided Taghut, lest they worship it, and turned back to Allah - for them are good tidings. So give good tidings to My servants
Who listen to speech and follow the best of it. Those are the ones Allah has guided, and those are people of understanding.
Then, is one who has deserved the decree of punishment [to be guided]? Then, can you save one who is in the Fire?
But those who have feared their Lord - for them are chambers, above them chambers built high, beneath which rivers flow. [This is] the promise of Allah. Allah does not fail in [His] promise.
Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky and makes it flow as springs [and rivers] in the earth; then He produces thereby crops of varying colors; then they dry and you see them turned yellow; then He makes them [scattered] debris. Indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding.
So is one whose breast Allah has expanded to [accept] Islam and he is upon a light from his Lord [like one whose heart rejects it]? Then woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah. Those are in manifest error.
Allah has sent down the best statement: a consistent Book wherein is reiteration. The skins shiver therefrom of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts relax at the remembrance of Allah. That is the guidance of Allah by which He guides whom He wills. And one whom Allah leaves astray - for him there is no guide.
Then is he who will shield with his face the worst of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection [like one secure from it]? And it will be said to the wrongdoers, "Taste what you used to earn."
Those before them denied, and punishment came upon them from where they did not perceive.
So Allah made them taste disgrace in worldly life. But the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.
And We have certainly presented for the people in this Qur’an from every [kind of] example - that they might remember.
[It is] an Arabic Qur’an, without any deviance that they might become righteous.
Allah presents an example: a slave owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man - are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know.
Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die.
Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord, will dispute.
So who is more unjust than one who lies about Allah and denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a residence for the disbelievers?
And the one who has brought the truth and [they who] believed in it - those are the righteous.
They will have whatever they desire with their Lord. That is the reward of the doers of good -
That Allah may remove from them the worst of what they did and reward them their due for the best of what they used to do.
Is not Allah sufficient for His Servant [Prophet Muhammad]? And [yet], they threaten you with those [they worship] other than Him. And whoever Allah leaves astray - for him there is no guide.
And whoever Allah guides - for him there is no misleader. Is not Allah Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution?
And if you asked them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" they would surely say, "Allah." Say, "Then have you considered what you invoke besides Allah? If Allah intended me harm, are they removers of His harm; or if He intended me mercy, are they withholders of His mercy?" Say, "Sufficient for me is Allah; upon Him [alone] rely the [wise] reliers."
Say, "O my people, work according to your position, [for] indeed, I am working; and you are going to know
To whom will come a torment disgracing him and on whom will descend an enduring punishment."
Indeed, We sent down to you the Book for the people in truth. So whoever is guided - it is for [the benefit of] his soul; and whoever goes astray only goes astray to its detriment. And you are not a manager over them.
Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that do not die [He takes] during their sleep. Then He keeps those for which He has decreed death and releases the others for a specified term. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.
Or have they taken other than Allah as intercessors? Say, "Even though they do not possess [power over] anything, nor do they reason?"
Say, "To Allah belongs [the right to allow] intercession entirely. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you will be returned."
And when Allah is mentioned alone, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion, but when those [worshipped] other than Him are mentioned, immediately they rejoice.
Say, "O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, You will judge between your servants concerning that over which they used to differ."
And if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it, they would [attempt to] ransom themselves thereby from the worst of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. And there will appear to them from Allah that which they had not taken into account.
And there will appear to them the evils they had earned, and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
And when adversity touches man, he calls upon Us; then when We bestow on him a favor from Us, he says, "I have only been given it because of [my] knowledge." Rather, it is a trial, but most of them do not know.
Those before them had already said it, but they were not availed by what they used to earn.
And the evil consequences of what they earned struck them. And those who have wronged of these [people] will be afflicted by the evil consequences of what they earned; and they will not cause failure.
Do they not know that Allah extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
Say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."
And return [in repentance] to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you; then you will not be helped.
And follow the best of what was revealed to you from your Lord before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you do not perceive,
Lest a soul should say, "Oh [how great is] my regret over what I neglected in regard to Allah and that I was among the mockers."
Or [lest] it say, "If only Allah had guided me, I would have been among the righteous."
Or [lest] it say when it sees the punishment, "If only I had another turn so I could be among the doers of good."
But yes, there had come to you My verses, but you denied them and were arrogant, and you were among the disbelievers.
And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied about Allah [with] their faces blackened. Is there not in Hell a residence for the arrogant?
And Allah will save those who feared Him by their attainment; no evil will touch them, nor will they grieve.
Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, Disposer of affairs.
To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. And they who disbelieve in the verses of Allah - it is those who are the losers.
Say, [O Muhammad], "Is it other than Allah that you order me to worship, O ignorant ones?"
And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers."
Rather, worship [only] Allah and be among the grateful.
They have not appraised Allah with true appraisal, while the earth entirely will be [within] His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand. Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.
And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.
And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the record [of deeds] will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and it will be judged between them in truth, and they will not be wronged.
And every soul will be fully compensated [for] what it did; and He is most knowing of what they do.
And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups until, when they reach it, its gates are opened and its keepers will say, "Did there not come to you messengers from yourselves, reciting to you the verses of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?" They will say, "Yes, but the word of punishment has come into effect upon the disbelievers.
[To them] it will be said, "Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant."
But those who feared their Lord will be driven to Paradise in groups until, when they reach it while its gates have been opened and its keepers say, "Peace be upon you; you have become pure; so enter it to abide eternally therein," [they will enter].
And they will say, "Praise to Allah, who has fulfilled for us His promise and made us inherit the earth [so] we may settle in Paradise wherever we will. And excellent is the reward of [righteous] workers."
And you will see the angels surrounding the Throne, exalting [Allah] with praise of their Lord. And it will be judged between them in truth, and it will be said, "[All] praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds."
Ha, Meem.
The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
The forgiver of sin, acceptor of repentance, severe in punishment, owner of abundance. There is no deity except Him; to Him is the destination.
No one disputes concerning the signs of Allah except those who disbelieve, so be not deceived by their [uninhibited] movement throughout the land.
The people of Noah denied before them and the [disbelieving] factions after them, and every nation intended [a plot] for their messenger to seize him, and they disputed by [using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalidate thereby the truth. So I seized them, and how [terrible] was My penalty.
And thus has the word of your Lord come into effect upon those who disbelieved that they are companions of the Fire.
Those [angels] who carry the Throne and those around it exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who have believed, [saying], "Our Lord, You have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who have repented and followed Your way and protect them from the punishment of Hellfire.
Our Lord, and admit them to gardens of perpetual residence which You have promised them and whoever was righteous among their fathers, their spouses and their offspring. Indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
And protect them from the evil consequences [of their deeds]. And he whom You protect from evil consequences that Day - You will have given him mercy. And that is the great attainment."
Indeed, those who disbelieve will be addressed, "The hatred of Allah for you was [even] greater than your hatred of yourselves [this Day in Hell] when you were invited to faith, but you refused."
They will say, "Our Lord, You made us lifeless twice and gave us life twice, and we have confessed our sins. So is there to an exit any way?"
[They will be told], "That is because, when Allah was called upon alone, you disbelieved; but if others were associated with Him, you believed. So the judgement is with Allah, the Most High, the Grand."
It is He who shows you His signs and sends down to you from the sky, provision. But none will remember except he who turns back [in repentance].
So invoke Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion, although the disbelievers dislike it.
[He is] the Exalted above [all] degrees, Owner of the Throne; He places the inspiration of His command upon whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of Meeting.
The Day they come forth nothing concerning them will be concealed from Allah. To whom belongs [all] sovereignty this Day? To Allah, the One, the Prevailing.
This Day every soul will be recompensed for what it earned. No injustice today! Indeed, Allah is swift in account.
And warn them, [O Muhammad], of the Approaching Day, when hearts are at the throats, filled [with distress]. For the wrongdoers there will be no devoted friend and no intercessor [who is] obeyed.
He knows that which deceives the eyes and what the breasts conceal.
And Allah judges with truth, while those they invoke besides Him judge not with anything. Indeed, Allah - He is the Hearing, the Seeing.
Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those who were before them? They were greater than them in strength and in impression on the land, but Allah seized them for their sins. And they had not from Allah any protector.
That was because their messengers were coming to them with clear proofs, but they disbelieved, so Allah seized them. Indeed, He is Powerful and severe in punishment.
And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs and a clear authority
To Pharaoh, Haman and Qarun; but they said, "[He is] a magician and a liar."
And when he brought them the truth from Us, they said, "Kill the sons of those who have believed with him and keep their women alive." But the plan of the disbelievers is not except in error.
And Pharaoh said, "Let me kill Moses and let him call upon his Lord. Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption in the land."
But Moses said, "Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Account."
And a believing man from the family of Pharaoh who concealed his faith said, "Do you kill a man [merely] because he says, 'My Lord is Allah' while he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? And if he should be lying, then upon him is [the consequence of] his lie; but if he should be truthful, there will strike you some of what he promises you. Indeed, Allah does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar.
O my people, sovereignty is yours today, [your being] dominant in the land. But who would protect us from the punishment of Allah if it came to us?" Pharaoh said, "I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the way of right conduct."
And he who believed said, "O my people, indeed I fear for you [a fate] like the day of the companies -
Like the custom of the people of Noah and of ‘Aad and Thamud and those after them. And Allah wants no injustice for [His] servants.
And O my people, indeed I fear for you the Day of Calling -
The Day you will turn your backs fleeing; there is not for you from Allah any protector. And whoever Allah leaves astray - there is not for him any guide.
And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, 'Never will Allah send a messenger after him.' Thus does Allah leave astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic."
Those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah without an authority having come to them - great is hatred [of them] in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who have believed. Thus does Allah seal over every heart [belonging to] an arrogant tyrant.
And Pharaoh said, "O Haman, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways -
The ways into the heavens - so that I may look at the deity of Moses; but indeed, I think he is a liar." And thus was made attractive to Pharaoh the evil of his deed, and he was averted from the [right] way. And the plan of Pharaoh was not except in ruin.
And he who believed said, "O my people, follow me, I will guide you to the way of right conduct.
O my people, this worldly life is only [temporary] enjoyment, and indeed, the Hereafter - that is the home of [permanent] settlement.
Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by the like thereof; but whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - those will enter Paradise, being given provision therein without account.
And O my people, how is it that I invite you to salvation while you invite me to the Fire?
You invite me to disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I invite you to the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver.
Assuredly, that to which you invite me has no [response to a] supplication in this world or in the Hereafter; and indeed, our return is to Allah, and indeed, the transgressors will be companions of the Fire.
And you will remember what I [now] say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of [His] servants."
So Allah protected him from the evils they plotted, and the people of Pharaoh were enveloped by the worst of punishment -
The Fire, they are exposed to it morning and evening. And the Day the Hour appears [it will be said], "Make the people of Pharaoh enter the severest punishment."
And [mention] when they will argue within the Fire, and the weak will say to those who had been arrogant, "Indeed, we were [only] your followers, so will you relieve us of a share of the Fire?"
Those who had been arrogant will say, "Indeed, all [of us] are in it. Indeed, Allah has judged between the servants."
And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, "Supplicate your Lord to lighten for us a day from the punishment."
They will say, "Did there not come to you your messengers with clear proofs?" They will say, "Yes." They will reply, "Then supplicate [yourselves], but the supplication of the disbelievers is not except in error."
Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will stand -
The Day their excuse will not benefit the wrongdoers, and they will have the curse, and they will have the worst home.
And We had certainly given Moses guidance, and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit the Scripture
As guidance and a reminder for those of understanding.
So be patient, [O Muhammad]. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And ask forgiveness for your sin and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.
Indeed, those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah without [any] authority having come to them - there is not within their breasts except pride, [the extent of] which they cannot reach. So seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Seeing.
The creation of the heavens and earth is greater than the creation of mankind, but most of the people do not know.
And not equal are the blind and the seeing, nor are those who believe and do righteous deeds and the evildoer. Little do you remember.
Indeed, the Hour is coming - no doubt about it - but most of the people do not believe.
And your Lord says, "Call upon Me; I will respond to you." Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible.
It is Allah who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day giving sight. Indeed, Allah is full of bounty to the people, but most of the people are not grateful.
That is Allah, your Lord, Creator of all things; there is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded?
Thus were those [before you] deluded who were rejecting the signs of Allah.
It is Allah who made for you the earth a place of settlement and the sky a ceiling and formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with good things. That is Allah, your Lord; then blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds.
He is the Ever-Living; there is no deity except Him, so call upon Him, [being] sincere to Him in religion. [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds.
Say, [O Muhammad], "Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you call upon besides Allah once the clear proofs have come to me from my Lord, and I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds."
It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot; then He brings you out as a child; then [He develops you] that you reach your [time of] maturity, then [further] that you become elders. And among you is he who is taken in death before [that], so that you reach a specified term; and perhaps you will use reason.
He it is who gives life and causes death; and when He decrees a matter, He but says to it, "Be," and it is.
Do you not consider those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah - how are they averted?
Those who deny the Book and that with which We sent Our messengers - they are going to know,
When the shackles are around their necks and the chains; they will be dragged
In boiling water; then in the Fire they will be filled [with flame].
Then it will be said to them, "Where is that which you used to associate [with Him in worship]
Other than Allah?" They will say, "They have departed from us; rather, we did not used to invoke previously anything." Thus does Allah put astray the disbelievers.
[The angels will say], "That was because you used to exult upon the earth without right and you used to behave insolently.
Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant."
So be patient, [O Muhammad]; indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And whether We show you some of what We have promised them or We take you in death, it is to Us they will be returned.
And We have already sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you. And it was not for any messenger to bring a sign [or verse] except by permission of Allah. So when the command of Allah comes, it will be concluded in truth, and the falsifiers will thereupon lose [all].
It is Allah who made for you the grazing animals upon which you ride, and some of them you eat.
And for you therein are [other] benefits and that you may realize upon them a need which is in your breasts; and upon them and upon ships you are carried.
And He shows you His signs. So which of the signs of Allah do you deny?
Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? They were more numerous than themselves and greater in strength and in impression on the land, but they were not availed by what they used to earn.
And when their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they [merely] rejoiced in what they had of knowledge, but they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
And when they saw Our punishment, they said," We believe in Allah alone and disbelieve in that which we used to associate with Him."
But never did their faith benefit them once they saw Our punishment. [It is] the established way of Allah which has preceded among His servants. And the disbelievers thereupon lost [all].
Ha, Meem.
[This is] a revelation from the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful -
A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic Qur’an for a people who know,
As a giver of good tidings and a warner; but most of them turn away, so they do not hear.
And they say, "Our hearts are within coverings from that to which you invite us, and in our ears is deafness, and between us and you is a partition, so work; indeed, we are working."
Say, O [Muhammad], "I am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a straight course to Him and seek His forgiveness." And woe to those who associate others with Allah -
Those who do not give zakah, and in the Hereafter they are disbelievers.
Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds - for them is a reward uninterrupted.
Say, "Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds."
And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined therein its [creatures'] sustenance in four days without distinction - for [the information] of those who ask.
Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, "Come [into being], willingly or by compulsion." They said, "We have come willingly."
And He completed them as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
But if they turn away, then say, "I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt [that struck] ‘Aad and Thamud.
[That occurred] when the messengers had come to them before them and after them, [saying], "Worship not except Allah." They said, "If our Lord had willed, He would have sent down the angels, so indeed we, in that with which you have been sent, are disbelievers."
As for ‘Aad, they were arrogant upon the earth without right and said, "Who is greater than us in strength?" Did they not consider that Allah who created them was greater than them in strength? But they were rejecting Our signs.
So We sent upon them a screaming wind during days of misfortune to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life; but the punishment of the Hereafter is more disgracing, and they will not be helped.
And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them for what they used to earn.
And We saved those who believed and used to fear Allah.
And [mention, O Muhammad], the Day when the enemies of Allah will be gathered to the Fire while they are [driven] assembled in rows,
Until, when they reach it, their hearing and their eyes and their skins will testify against them of what they used to do.
And they will say to their skins, "Why have you testified against us?" They will say, "We were made to speak by Allah, who has made everything speak; and He created you the first time, and to Him you are returned.
And you were not covering yourselves, lest your hearing testify against you or your sight or your skins, but you assumed that Allah does not know much of what you do.
And that was your assumption which you assumed about your Lord. It has brought you to ruin, and you have become among the losers."
So [even] if they are patient, the Fire is a residence for them; and if they ask to appease [Allah], they will not be of those who are allowed to appease.
And We appointed for them companions who made attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them [of sin], and the word has come into effect upon them among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men. Indeed, they [all] were losers.
And those who disbelieve say, "Do not listen to this Qur’an and speak noisily during [the recitation of] it that perhaps you will overcome."
But We will surely cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe punishment, and We will surely recompense them for the worst of what they had been doing.
That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah - the Fire. For them therein is the home of eternity as recompense for what they, of Our verses, were rejecting.
And those who disbelieved will [then] say, "Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men [so] we may put them under our feet that they will be among the lowest."
Indeed, those who have said, "Our Lord is Allah" and then remained on a right course - the angels will descend upon them, [saying], "Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.
We [angels] were your allies in worldly life and [are so] in the Hereafter. And you will have therein whatever your souls desire, and you will have therein whatever you request [or wish]
As accommodation from a [Lord who is] Forgiving and Merciful."
And who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says, "Indeed, I am of the Muslims."
And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.
But none is granted it except those who are patient, and none is granted it except one having a great portion [of good].
And if there comes to you from Satan an evil suggestion, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostate to Allah, who created them, if it should be Him that you worship.
But if they are arrogant - then those who are near your Lord exalt Him by night and by day, and they do not become weary.
And of His signs is that you see the earth stilled, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and grows. Indeed, He who has given it life is the Giver of Life to the dead. Indeed, He is over all things competent.
Indeed, those who inject deviation into Our verses are not concealed from Us. So, is he who is cast into the Fire better or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you will; indeed, He is Seeing of what you do.
Indeed, those who disbelieve in the message after it has come to them... And indeed, it is a mighty Book.
Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; [it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy.
Nothing is said to you, [O Muhammad], except what was already said to the messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is a possessor of forgiveness and a possessor of painful penalty.
And if We had made it a non-Arabic Qur’an, they would have said, "Why are its verses not explained in detail [in our language]? Is it a foreign [recitation] and an Arab [messenger]?" Say, "It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure." And those who do not believe - in their ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness. Those are being called from a distant place.
And We had already given Moses the Scripture, but it came under disagreement. And if not for a word that preceded from your Lord, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed they are, concerning the Qur’an, in disquieting doubt.
Whoever does righteousness - it is for his [own] soul; and whoever does evil [does so] against it. And your Lord is not ever unjust to [His] servants.
To him [alone] is attributed knowledge of the Hour. And fruits emerge not from their coverings nor does a female conceive or give birth except with His knowledge. And the Day He will call to them, "Where are My 'partners’?" they will say, "We announce to You that there is [no longer] among us any witness [to that]."
And lost from them will be those they were invoking before, and they will be certain that they have no place of escape.
Man is not weary of supplication for good [things], but if evil touches him, he is hopeless and despairing.
And if We let him taste mercy from Us after an adversity which has touched him, he will surely say, "This is [due] to me, and I do not think the Hour will occur; and [even] if I should be returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best." But We will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did, and We will surely make them taste a massive punishment.
And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself; but when evil touches him, then he is full of extensive supplication.
Say, "Have you considered: if the Qur’an is from Allah and you disbelieved in it, who would be more astray than one who is in extreme dissension?"
We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth. But is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness?
Unquestionably, they are in doubt about the meeting with their Lord. Unquestionably He is, of all things, encompassing.
Ha, Meem.
‘Ayn, Seen, Qaf.
Thus has He revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and to those before you - Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.
The heavens almost break from above them, and the angels exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Unquestionably, it is Allah who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
And those who take as allies other than Him - Allah is [yet] Guardian over them; and you, [O Muhammad], are not over them a manager.
And thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur’an that you may warn the Mother of Cities [Makkah] and those around it and warn of the Day of Assembly, about which there is no doubt. A party will be in Paradise and a party in the Blaze.
And if Allah willed, He could have made them [of] one religion, but He admits whom He wills into His mercy. And the wrongdoers have not any protector or helper.
Or have they taken protectors [or allies] besides him? But Allah - He is the Protector, and He gives life to the dead, and He is over all things competent.
And in anything over which you disagree - its ruling is [to be referred] to Allah. [Say], "That is Allah, my Lord; upon Him I have relied, and to Him I turn back."
[He is] Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you from yourselves, mates, and among the cattle, mates; He multiplies you thereby. There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.
To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. Indeed He is, of all things, Knowing.
He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - to establish the religion and not be divided therein. Difficult for those who associate others with Allah is that to which you invite them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].
And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And if not for a word that preceded from your Lord [postponing the penalty] until a specified time, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed, those who were granted inheritance of the Scripture after them are, concerning it, in disquieting doubt.
So to that [religion of Allah] invite, [O Muhammad], and remain on a right course as you are commanded and do not follow their inclinations but say, "I have believed in what Allah has revealed of the Qur’an, and I have been commanded to do justice among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. For us are our deeds, and for you your deeds. There is no [need for] argument between us and you. Allah will bring us together, and to Him is the [final] destination."
And those who argue concerning Allah after He has been responded to - their argument is invalid with their Lord, and upon them is [His] wrath, and for them is a severe punishment.
It is Allah who has sent down the Book in truth and [also] the balance. And what will make you perceive? Perhaps the Hour is near.
Those who do not believe in it are impatient for it, but those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth. Unquestionably, those who dispute concerning the Hour are in extreme error.
Allah is Subtle with His servants; He gives provisions to whom He wills. And He is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might.
Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter - We increase for him in his harvest. And whoever desires the harvest of this world - We give him thereof, but there is not for him in the Hereafter any share.
Or have they other deities who have ordained for them a religion to which Allah has not consented? But if not for the decisive word, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed, the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment.
You will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned, and it will [certainly] befall them. And those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens [in Paradise] having whatever they will in the presence of their Lord. That is what is the great bounty.
It is that of which Allah gives good tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say, [O Muhammad], "I do not ask you for this message any payment [but] only good will through kinship." And whoever commits a good deed - We will increase for him good therein. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative.
Or do they say, "He has invented about Allah a lie"? But if Allah willed, He could seal over your heart. And Allah eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by His words. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
And it is He who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do.
And He answers [the supplication of] those who have believed and done righteous deeds and increases [for] them from His bounty. But the disbelievers will have a severe punishment.
And if Allah had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.
And it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy.
And of his signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and what He has dispersed throughout them of creatures. And He, for gathering them when He wills, is competent.
And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; but He pardons much.
And you will not cause failure [to Allah] upon the earth. And you have not besides Allah any protector or helper.
And of His signs are the ships in the sea, like mountains.
If He willed, He could still the wind, and they would remain motionless on its surface. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.
Or He could destroy them for what they earned; but He pardons much.
And [that is so] those who dispute concerning Our signs may know that for them there is no place of escape.
So whatever thing you have been given - it is but [for] enjoyment of the worldly life. But what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their Lord rely
And those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, and when they are angry, they forgive,
And those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves, and from what We have provided them, they spend.
And those who, when tyranny strikes them, they defend themselves,
And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation - his reward is [due] from Allah. Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers.
And whoever avenges himself after having been wronged - those have not upon them any cause [for blame].
The cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right. Those will have a painful punishment.
And whoever is patient and forgives - indeed, that is of the matters [requiring] determination.
And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no protector beyond Him. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, "Is there for return [to the former world] any way?"
And you will see them being exposed to the Fire, humbled from humiliation, looking from [behind] a covert glance. And those who had believed will say, "Indeed, the [true] losers are the ones who lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, the wrongdoers are in an enduring punishment."
And there will not be for them any allies to aid them other than Allah. And whoever Allah sends astray - for him there is no way.
Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from Allah of which there is no repelling. No refuge will you have that day, nor for you will there be any denial.
But if they turn away - then We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], over them as a guardian; upon you is only [the duty of] notification. And indeed, when We let man taste mercy from us, he rejoices in it; but if evil afflicts him for what his hands have put forth, then indeed, man is ungrateful.
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; He creates what he wills. He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males.
Or He makes them [both] males and females, and He renders whom He wills barren. Indeed, He is Knowing and Competent.
And it is not for any human being that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He sends a messenger to reveal, by His permission, what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise.
And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our command. You did not know what is the Book or [what is] faith, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants. And indeed, [O Muhammad], you guide to a straight path -
The path of Allah, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Unquestionably, to Allah do [all] matters evolve.
Ha, Meem.
By the clear Book,
Indeed, We have made it an Arabic Qur’an that you might understand.
And indeed it is, in the Mother of the Book with Us, exalted and full of wisdom.
Then should We turn the message away, disregarding you, because you are a transgressing people?
And how many a prophet We sent among the former peoples,
But there would not come to them a prophet except that they used to ridicule him.
And We destroyed greater than them in [striking] power, and the example of the former peoples has preceded.
And if you should ask them, "Who has created the heavens and the earth?" they would surely say, "They were created by the Exalted in Might, the Knowing."
[The one] who has made for you the earth a bed and made for you upon it roads that you might be guided
And who sends down rain from the sky in measured amounts, and We revive thereby a dead land - thus will you be brought forth -
And who created the species, all of them, and has made for you of ships and animals those which you mount.
That you may settle yourselves upon their backs and then remember the favor of your Lord when you have settled upon them and say. "Exalted is He who has subjected this to us, and we could not have [otherwise] subdued it.
And indeed we, to our Lord, will [surely] return."
But they have attributed to Him from His servants a portion. Indeed, man is clearly ungrateful.
Or has He taken, out of what He has created, daughters and chosen you for [having] sons?
And when one of them is given good tidings of that which he attributes to the Most Merciful in comparison, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.
So is one brought up in ornaments while being during conflict unevident [attributed to Allah]?
And they have made the angels, who are servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned.
And they said, "If the Most Merciful had willed, we would not have worshipped them." They have of that no knowledge. They are not but falsifying.
Or have We given them a book before the Qur’an to which they are adhering?
Rather, they say, "Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are in their footsteps [rightly] guided."
And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, "Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following."
[Each warner] said, "Even if I brought you better guidance than that [religion] upon which you found your fathers?" They said, "Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers."
So we took retribution from them; then see how was the end of the deniers.
And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said to his father and his people, "Indeed, I am disassociated from that which you worship
Except for He who created me; and indeed, He will guide me."
And he made it a word remaining among his descendants that they might return [to it].
However, I gave enjoyment to these [people of Makkah] and their fathers until there came to them the truth and a clear Messenger.
But when the truth came to them, they said, "This is magic, and indeed we are, concerning it, disbelievers."
And they said, "Why was this Qur’an not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?"
Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees [of rank] that they may make use of one another for service. But the mercy of your Lord is better than whatever they accumulate.
And if it were not that the people would become one community [of disbelievers], We would have made for those who disbelieve in the Most Merciful - for their houses - ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount
And for their houses - doors and couches [of silver] upon which to recline
And gold ornament. But all that is not but the enjoyment of worldly life. And the Hereafter with your Lord is for the righteous.
And whoever is blinded from remembrance of the Most Merciful - We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion.
And indeed, the devils avert them from the way [of guidance] while they think that they are [rightly] guided
Until, when he comes to Us [at Judgement], he says [to his companion], "Oh, I wish there was between me and you the distance between the east and west - how wretched a companion."
And never will it benefit you that Day, when you have wronged, that you are [all] sharing in the punishment.
Then will you make the deaf hear, [O Muhammad], or guide the blind or he who is in clear error?
And whether [or not] We take you away [in death], indeed, We will take retribution upon them.
Or whether [or not] We show you that which We have promised them, indeed, We are Perfect in Ability.
So adhere to that which is revealed to you. Indeed, you are on a straight path.
And indeed, it is a remembrance for you and your people, and you [all] are going to be questioned.
And ask those We sent before you of Our messengers; have We made besides the Most Merciful deities to be worshipped?
And certainly did We send Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his establishment, and he said, "Indeed, I am the messenger of the Lord of the worlds."
But when he brought them Our signs, at once they laughed at them.
And We showed them not a sign except that it was greater than its sister, and We seized them with affliction that perhaps they might return [to faith].
And they said [to Moses], "O magician, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised you. Indeed, we will be guided."
But when We removed from them the affliction, at once they broke their word.
And Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, "O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers flowing beneath me; then do you not see?
Or am I [not] better than this one who is insignificant and hardly makes himself clear?
Then why have there not been placed upon him bracelets of gold or come with him the angels in conjunction?"
So he bluffed his people, and they obeyed him. Indeed, they were [themselves] a people defiantly disobedient [of Allah].
And when they angered Us, We took retribution from them and drowned them all.
And We made them a precedent and an example for the later peoples.
And when the son of Mary was presented as an example, immediately your people laughed aloud.
And they said, "Are your gods better, or is he?" They did not present the comparison except for [mere] argument. But, [in fact], they are a people prone to dispute.
Jesus was not but a servant upon whom We bestowed favor, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.
And if We willed, We could have made [instead] of you angels succeeding [one another] on the earth.
And indeed, Jesus will be [a sign for] knowledge of the Hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow Me. This is a straight path.
And never let Satan avert you. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.
And when Jesus brought clear proofs, he said, "I have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ, so fear Allah and obey me.
Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path."
But the denominations from among them differed [and separated], so woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of a painful Day.
Are they waiting except for the Hour to come upon them suddenly while they perceive not?
Close friends, that Day, will be enemies to each other, except for the righteous
[To whom Allah will say], "O My servants, no fear will there be concerning you this Day, nor will you grieve,
[You] who believed in Our verses and were Muslims.
Enter Paradise, you and your kinds, delighted."
Circulated among them will be plates and vessels of gold. And therein is whatever the souls desire and [what] delights the eyes, and you will abide therein eternally.
And that is Paradise which you are made to inherit for what you used to do.
For you therein is much fruit from which you will eat.
Indeed, the criminals will be in the punishment of Hell, abiding eternally.
It will not be allowed to subside for them, and they, therein, are in despair.
And We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the wrongdoers.
And they will call, "O Malik, let your Lord put an end to us!" He will say, "Indeed, you will remain."
We had certainly brought you the truth, but most of you, to the truth, were averse.
Or have they devised [some] affair? But indeed, We are devising [a plan].
Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private conversations? Yes, [We do], and Our messengers are with them recording.
Say, [O Muhammad], "If the Most Merciful had a son, then I would be the first of [his] worshippers."
Exalted is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe.
So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their Day which they are promised.
And it is Allah who is [the only] deity in the heaven, and on the earth [the only] deity. And He is the Wise, the Knowing.
And blessed is He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with whom is knowledge of the Hour and to whom you will be returned.
And those they invoke besides Him do not possess [power of] intercession; but only those who testify to the truth [can benefit], and they know.
And if you asked them who created them, they would surely say, "Allah." So how are they deluded?
And [Allah acknowledges] his saying, "O my Lord, indeed these are a people who do not believe."
So turn aside from them and say, "Peace." But they are going to know.
Ha, Meem.
By the clear Book,
Indeed, We sent it down during a blessed night. Indeed, We were to warn [mankind].
On that night is made distinct every precise matter -
[Every] matter [proceeding] from Us. Indeed, We were to send [a messenger]
As mercy from your Lord. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them, if you would be certain.
There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death. [He is] your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers.
But they are in doubt, amusing themselves.
Then watch for the Day when the sky will bring a visible smoke.
Covering the people; this is a painful torment.
[They will say], "Our Lord, remove from us the torment; indeed, we are believers."
How will there be for them a reminder [at that time]? And there had come to them a clear Messenger.
Then they turned away from him and said, "[He was] taught [and is] a madman."
Indeed, We will remove the torment for a little. Indeed, you [disbelievers] will return [to disbelief].
The Day We will strike with the greatest assault, indeed, We will take retribution.
And We had already tried before them the people of Pharaoh, and there came to them a noble messenger,
[Saying], "Render to me the servants of Allah. Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger,"
And [saying], "Be not haughty with Allah. Indeed, I have come to you with clear authority.
And indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord, lest you stone me.
But if you do not believe me, then leave me alone."
And [finally] he called to his Lord that these were a criminal people.
[Allah said], "Then set out with My servants by night. Indeed, you are to be pursued.
And leave the sea in stillness. Indeed, they are an army to be drowned."
How much they left behind of gardens and springs
And crops and noble sites
And comfort wherein they were amused.
Thus. And We caused to inherit it another people.
And the heaven and earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved.
And We certainly saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment -
From Pharaoh. Indeed, he was a haughty one among the transgressors.
And We certainly chose them by knowledge over [all] the worlds.
And We gave them of signs that in which there was a clear trial.
Indeed, these [disbelievers] are saying,
"There is not but our first death, and we will not be resurrected.
Then bring [back] our forefathers, if you should be truthful."
Are they better or the people of Tubba‘ and those before them? We destroyed them, [for] indeed, they were criminals.
And We did not create the heavens and earth and that between them in play.
We did not create them except in truth, but most of them do not know.
Indeed, the Day of Judgement is the appointed time for them all -
The Day when no relation will avail a relation at all, nor will they be helped -
Except those [believers] on whom Allah has mercy. Indeed, He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
Indeed, the tree of zaqqum
Is food for the sinful.
Like murky oil, it boils within bellies
Like the boiling of scalding water.
[It will be commanded], "Seize him and drag him into the midst of the Hellfire,
Then pour over his head from the torment of scalding water."
[It will be said], "Taste! Indeed, you are the honored, the noble!
Indeed, this is what you used to dispute."
Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place;
Within gardens and springs,
Wearing [garments of] fine silk and brocade, facing each other.
Thus. And We will marry them to fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes.
They will call therein for every [kind of] fruit - safe and secure.
They will not taste death therein except the first death, and He will have protected them from the punishment of Hellfire
As bounty from your Lord. That is what is the great attainment.
And indeed, We have eased the Qur’an in your tongue that they might be reminded.
So watch, [O Muhammad]; indeed, they are watching [for your end].
Ha, Meem.
The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
Indeed, within the heavens and earth are signs for the believers.
And in the creation of yourselves and what He disperses of moving creatures are signs for people who are certain [in faith].
And [in] the alternation of night and day and [in] what Allah sends down from the sky of provision and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and [in His] directing of the winds are signs for a people who reason.
These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you in truth. Then in what statement after Allah and His verses will they believe?
Woe to every sinful liar
Who hears the verses of Allah recited to him, then persists arrogantly as if he had not heard them. So give him tidings of a painful punishment.
And when he knows anything of Our verses, he takes them in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment.
Before them is Hell, and what they had earned will not avail them at all nor what they had taken besides Allah as allies. And they will have a great punishment.
This [Qur’an] is guidance. And those who have disbelieved in the verses of their Lord will have a painful punishment of foul nature.
It is Allah who subjected to you the sea so that ships may sail upon it by His command and that you may seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be grateful.
And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth - all from Him. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.
Say, [O Muhammad], to those who have believed that they [should] forgive those who expect not the days of Allah so that He may recompense a people for what they used to earn.
Whoever does a good deed - it is for himself; and whoever does evil - it is against the self. Then to your Lord you will be returned.
And We did certainly give the Children of Israel the Scripture and judgement and prophethood, and We provided them with good things and preferred them over the worlds.
And We gave them clear proofs of the matter [of religion]. And they did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.
Then We put you, [O Muhammad], on an ordained way concerning the matter [of religion]; so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know.
Indeed, they will never avail you against Allah at all. And indeed, the wrongdoers are allies of one another; but Allah is the protector of the righteous.
This [Qur’an] is enlightenment for mankind and guidance and mercy for a people who are certain [in faith].
Or do those who commit evils think We will make them like those who have believed and done righteous deeds - [make them] equal in their life and their death? Evil is that which they judge.
And Allah created the heavens and earth in truth and so that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
Have you seen he who has taken as his god his [own] desire, and Allah has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil? So who will guide him after Allah? Then will you not be reminded?
And they say, "There is not but our worldly life; we die and live, and nothing destroys us except time." And they have of that no knowledge; they are only assuming.
And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, their argument is only that they say, "Bring [back] our forefathers, if you should be truthful."
Say, "Allah causes you to live, then causes you to die; then He will assemble you for the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt, but most of the people do not know."
And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And the Day the Hour appears - that Day the falsifiers will lose.
And you will see every nation kneeling [from fear]. Every nation will be called to its record [and told], "Today you will be recompensed for what you used to do.
This, Our record, speaks about you in truth. Indeed, We were having transcribed whatever you used to do."
So as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them into His mercy. That is what is the clear attainment.
But as for those who disbelieved, [it will be said], "Were not Our verses recited to you, but you were arrogant and became a people of criminals?
And when it was said, 'Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth and the Hour [is coming] - no doubt about it,' you said, 'We know not what is the Hour. We assume only assumption, and we are not convinced.' "
And the evil consequences of what they did will appear to them, and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
And it will be said, "Today We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours, and your refuge is the Fire, and for you there are no helpers.
That is because you took the verses of Allah in ridicule, and worldly life deluded you." So that Day they will not be removed from it, nor will they be asked to appease [Allah].
Then, to Allah belongs [all] praise - Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of the worlds.
And to Him belongs [all] grandeur within the heavens and the earth, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
Ha, Meem.
The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
We did not create the heavens and earth and what is between them except in truth and [for] a specified term. But those who disbelieve, from that of which they are warned, are turning away.
Say, [O Muhammad], "Have you considered that which you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth; or did they have partnership in [creation of] the heavens? Bring me a scripture [revealed] before this or a [remaining] trace of knowledge, if you should be truthful."
And who is more astray than he who invokes besides Allah those who will not respond to him until the Day of Resurrection, and they, of their invocation, are unaware.
And when the people are gathered [that Day], they [who were invoked] will be enemies to them, and they will be deniers of their worship.
And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, "This is obvious magic."
Or do they say, "He has invented it?" Say, "If I have invented it, you will not possess for me [the power of protection] from Allah at all. He is most knowing of that in which you are involved. Sufficient is He as Witness between me and you, and He is the Forgiving the Merciful."
Say, "I am not something original among the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am not but a clear warner."
Say, "Have you considered: if the Qur’an was from Allah, and you disbelieved in it while a witness from the Children of Israel has testified to something similar and believed while you were arrogant...?" Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
And those who disbelieve say of those who believe, "If it had [truly] been good, they would not have preceded us to it." And when they are not guided by it, they will say, "This is an ancient falsehood."
And before it was the scripture of Moses to lead and as a mercy. And this is a confirming Book in an Arabic tongue to warn those who have wronged and as good tidings to the doers of good.
Indeed, those who have said, "Our Lord is Allah," and then remained on a right course - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.
Those are the companions of Paradise, abiding eternally therein as reward for what they used to do.
And We have enjoined upon man, to his parents, good treatment. His mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship, and his gestation and weaning [period] is thirty months. [He grows] until, when he reaches maturity and reaches [the age of] forty years, he says, "My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which You will approve and make righteous for me my offspring. Indeed, I have repented to You, and indeed, I am of the Muslims."
Those are the ones from whom We will accept the best of what they did and overlook their misdeeds, [their being] among the companions of Paradise. [That is] the promise of truth which they had been promised.
But one who says to his parents, "Uff to you; do you promise me that I will be brought forth [from the earth] when generations before me have already passed on [into oblivion]?" while they call to Allah for help [and to their son], "Woe to you! Believe! Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth." But he says, "This is not but legends of the former people" -
Those are the ones upon whom the word has come into effect, [who will be] among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men. Indeed, they [all] were losers.
And for all there are degrees [of reward and punishment] for what they have done, and [it is] so that He may fully compensate them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.
And the Day those who disbelieved are exposed to the Fire [it will be said], "You exhausted your pleasures during your worldly life and enjoyed them, so this Day you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation because you were arrogant upon the earth without right and because you were defiantly disobedient."
And mention, [O Muhammad], the brother of ‘Aad, when he warned his people in the [region of] al-Ahqaf - and warners had already passed on before him and after him - [saying], "Do not worship except Allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day."
They said, "Have you come to delude us away from our gods? Then bring us what you promise us, if you should be of the truthful."
He said, "Knowledge [of its time] is only with Allah, and I convey to you that with which I was sent; but I see you [to be] a people behaving ignorantly."
And when they saw it as a cloud approaching their valleys, they said, "This is a cloud bringing us rain!" Rather, it is that for which you were impatient: a wind, within it a painful punishment,
Destroying everything by command of its Lord. And they became so that nothing was seen [of them] except their dwellings. Thus do We recompense the criminal people.
And We had certainly established them in such as We have not established you, and We made for them hearing and vision and hearts. But their hearing and vision and hearts availed them not from anything [of the punishment] when they were [continually] rejecting the signs of Allah; and they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
And We have already destroyed what surrounds you of [those] cities, and We have diversified the signs [or verses] that perhaps they might return [from disbelief].
Then why did those they took besides Allah as deities by which to approach [Him] not aid them? But they had strayed from them. And that was their falsehood and what they were inventing.
And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Qur’an. And when they attended it, they said, "Listen quietly." And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners.
They said, "O our people, indeed we have heard a [recited] Book revealed after Moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path.
O our people, respond to the Messenger of Allah and believe in him; Allah will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.
But he who does not respond to the Caller of Allah will not cause failure [to Him] upon earth, and he will not have besides Him any protectors. Those are in manifest error."
Do they not see that Allah, who created the heavens and earth and did not fail in their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yes. Indeed, He is over all things competent.
And the Day those who disbelieved are exposed to the Fire [it will be said], "Is this not the truth?" They will say, "Yes, by our Lord." He will say, "Then taste the punishment because you used to disbelieve."
So be patient, [O Muhammad], as were those of determination among the messengers and do not be impatient for them. It will be - on the Day they see that which they are promised - as though they had not remained [in the world] except an hour of a day. [This is] notification. And will [any] be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people?
Those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of Allah - He will waste their deeds.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down upon Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition.
That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does Allah present to the people their comparisons.
So when you meet those who disbelieve [in battle], strike [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either [confer] favor afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens. That [is the command]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken vengeance upon them [Himself], but [He ordered armed struggle] to test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the cause of Allah - never will He waste their deeds.
He will guide them and amend their condition
And admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them.
O you who have believed, if you support Allah, He will support you and plant firmly your feet.
But those who disbelieve - for them is misery, and He will waste their deeds.
That is because they disliked what Allah revealed, so He rendered worthless their deeds.
Have they not traveled through the land and seen how was the end of those before them? Allah destroyed [everything] over them, and for the disbelievers is something comparable.
That is because Allah is the protector of those who have believed and because the disbelievers have no protector.
Indeed, Allah will admit those who have believed and done righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow, but those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as grazing livestock eat, and the Fire will be a residence for them.
And how many a city was stronger than your city [Makkah] which drove you out? We destroyed them; and there was no helper for them.
So is he who is on clear evidence from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work has been made attractive and they follow their [own] desires?
Is the description of Paradise, which the righteous are promised, wherein are rivers of water unaltered, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have from all [kinds of] fruits and forgiveness from their Lord, like [that of] those who abide eternally in the Fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines?
And among them, [O Muhammad], are those who listen to you, until when they depart from you, they say to those who were given knowledge, "What has he said just now?" Those are the ones of whom Allah has sealed over their hearts and who have followed their [own] desires.
And those who are guided - He increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness.
Then do they await except that the Hour should come upon them unexpectedly? But already there have come [some of] its indications. Then what good to them, when it has come, will be their remembrance?
So know, [O Muhammad], that there is no deity except Allah and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women. And Allah knows of your movement and your resting place.
Those who believe say, "Why has a surah not been sent down? But when a precise surah is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is hypocrisy looking at you with a look of one overcome by death. And more appropriate for them [would have been]
Obedience and good words. And when the matter [of fighting] was determined, if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them.
So would you perhaps, if you turned away, cause corruption on earth and sever your [ties of] relationship?
Those [who do so] are the ones that Allah has cursed, so He deafened them and blinded their vision.
Then do they not reflect upon the Qur’an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?
Indeed, those who reverted back [to disbelief] after guidance had become clear to them - Satan enticed them and prolonged hope for them.
That is because they said to those who disliked what Allah sent down, "We will obey you in part of the matter." And Allah knows what they conceal.
Then how [will it be] when the angels take them in death, striking their faces and their backs?
That is because they followed what angered Allah and disliked [what earns] His pleasure, so He rendered worthless their deeds.
Or do those in whose hearts is disease think that Allah would never expose their [feelings of] hatred?
And if We willed, We could show them to you, and you would know them by their mark; but you will surely know them by the tone of [their] speech. And Allah knows your deeds.
And We will surely test you until We make evident those who strive among you [for the cause of Allah] and the patient, and We will test your affairs.
Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted [people] from the path of Allah and opposed the Messenger after guidance had become clear to them - never will they harm Allah at all, and He will render worthless their deeds.
O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not invalidate your deeds.
Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted [people] from the path of Allah and then died while they were disbelievers - never will Allah forgive them.
So do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior; and Allah is with you and will never deprive you of [the reward of] your deeds.
[This] worldly life is only amusement and diversion. And if you believe and fear Allah, He will give you your rewards and not ask you for your properties.
If He should ask you for them and press you, you would withhold, and He would expose your unwillingness.
Here you are - those invited to spend in the cause of Allah - but among you are those who withhold [out of greed]. And whoever withholds only withholds [benefit] from himself; and Allah is the Free of need, while you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you with another people; then they will not be the likes of you.
Indeed, We have given you, [O Muhammad], a clear conquest
That Allah may forgive for you what preceded of your sin and what will follow and complete His favor upon you and guide you to a straight path
And [that] Allah may aid you with a mighty victory.
It is He who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they would increase in faith along with their [present] faith. And to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth, and ever is Allah Knowing and Wise.
[And] that He may admit the believing men and the believing women to gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein eternally and remove from them their misdeeds - and ever is that, in the sight of Allah, a great attainment -
And [that] He may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the polytheist men and polytheist women - those who assume about Allah an assumption of evil nature. Upon them is a misfortune of evil nature; and Allah has become angry with them and has cursed them and prepared for them Hell, and evil it is as a destination.
And to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.
Indeed, We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner
That you [people] may believe in Allah and His Messenger and honor him and respect the Prophet and exalt Allah morning and afternoon.
Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you, [O Muhammad] - they are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Allah is over their hands. So he who breaks his word only breaks it to the detriment of himself. And he who fulfills that which he has promised Allah - He will give him a great reward.
Those who remained behind of the bedouins will say to you, "Our properties and our families occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues what is not within their hearts. Say, "Then who could prevent Allah at all if He intended for you harm or intended for you benefit? Rather, ever is Allah, with what you do, Acquainted.
But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, ever, and that was made pleasing in your hearts. And you assumed an assumption of evil and became a people ruined."
And whoever has not believed in Allah and His Messenger - then indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers a Blaze.
And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
Those who remained behind will say when you set out toward the war booty to take it, "Let us follow you." They wish to change the words of Allah. Say, "Never will you follow us. Thus did Allah say before." So they will say, "Rather, you envy us." But [in fact] they were not understanding except a little.
Say to those who remained behind of the bedouins, "You will be called to [face] a people of great military might; you may fight them, or they will submit. So if you obey, Allah will give you a good reward; but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment."
There is not upon the blind any guilt or upon the lame any guilt or upon the ill any guilt [for remaining behind]. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger - He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow; but whoever turns away - He will punish him with a painful punishment.
Certainly was Allah pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest
And much war booty which they will take. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.
Allah has promised you much booty that you will take [in the future] and has hastened for you this [victory] and withheld the hands of people from you - that it may be a sign for the believers and [that] He may guide you to a straight path.
And [He promises] other [victories] that you were [so far] unable to [realize] which Allah has already encompassed. And ever is Allah, over all things, competent.
And if those [Makkans] who disbelieve had fought you, they would have turned their backs [in flight]. Then they would not find a protector or a helper.
[This is] the established way of Allah which has occurred before. And never will you find in the way of Allah any change.
And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within [the area of] Makkah after He caused you to overcome them. And ever is Allah of what you do, Seeing.
They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from al-Masjid al-Haram while the offering was prevented from reaching its place of sacrifice. And if not for believing men and believing women whom you did not know - that you might trample them and there would befall you because of them dishonor without [your] knowledge - [you would have been permitted to enter Makkah]. [This was so] that Allah might admit to His mercy whom He willed. If they had been apart [from them], We would have punished those who disbelieved among them with painful punishment
When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts chauvinism - the chauvinism of the time of ignorance. But Allah sent down His tranquillity upon His Messenger and upon the believers and imposed upon them the word of righteousness, and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it. And ever is Allah, of all things, Knowing.
Certainly has Allah showed to His Messenger the vision in truth. You will surely enter al-Masjid al-Haram, if Allah wills, in safety, with your heads shaved and [hair] shortened, not fearing [anyone]. He knew what you did not know and has arranged before that a conquest near [at hand].
It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion. And sufficient is Allah as Witness.
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.
O you who have believed, do not put [yourselves] before Allah and His Messenger but fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
O you who have believed, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others, lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not.
Indeed, those who lower their voices before the Messenger of Allah - they are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for righteousness. For them is forgiveness and great reward.
Indeed, those who call you, [O Muhammad], from behind the chambers - most of them do not use reason.
And if they had been patient until you [could] come out to them, it would have been better for them. But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful.
And know that among you is the Messenger of Allah. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would be in difficulty, but Allah has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience. Those are the [rightly] guided.
[It is] as bounty from Allah and favor. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.
And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between the two. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of Allah. And if it returns, then make settlement between them in justice and act justly. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.
The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between your brothers. And fear Allah that you may receive mercy.
O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them. And do not insult one another and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames. Wretched is the name of disobedience after [one's] faith. And whoever does not repent - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.
O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Accepting of repentance and Merciful.
O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.
The bedouins say, "We have believed." Say, "You have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted,' for faith has not yet entered your hearts. And if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not deprive you from your deeds of anything. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
The believers are only the ones who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of Allah. It is those who are the truthful.
Say, "Would you acquaint Allah with your religion while Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and Allah is Knowing of all things?"
They consider it a favor to you that they have accepted Islam. Say, "Do not consider your Islam a favor to me. Rather, Allah has conferred favor upon you that He has guided you to the faith, if you should be truthful."
Indeed, Allah knows the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Seeing of what you do.
Qaf. By the honored Qur’an...
But they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves, and the disbelievers say, "This is an amazing thing.
When we have died and have become dust, [we will return to life]? That is a distant return."
We know what the earth diminishes of them, and with Us is a retaining record.
But they denied the truth when it came to them, so they are in a confused condition.
Have they not looked at the heaven above them - how We structured it and adorned it and [how] it has no rifts?
And the earth - We spread it out and cast therein firmly set mountains and made grow therein [something] of every beautiful kind,
Giving insight and a reminder for every servant who turns [to Allah].
And We have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest
And lofty palm trees having fruit arranged in layers -
As provision for the servants, and We have given life thereby to a dead land. Thus is the resurrection.
The people of Noah denied before them, and the companions of the well and Thamud
And ‘Aad and Pharaoh and the brothers of Lot
And the companions of the thicket and the people of Tubba‘. All denied the messengers, so My threat was justly fulfilled.
Did We fail in the first creation? But they are in confusion over a new creation.
And We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein
When the two receivers receive, seated on the right and on the left.
Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record].
And the intoxication of death will bring the truth; that is what you were trying to avoid.
And the Horn will be blown. That is the Day of [carrying out] the threat.
And every soul will come, with it a driver and a witness.
[It will be said], "You were certainly in unmindfulness of this, and We have removed from you your cover, so your sight, this Day, is sharp."
And his companion, [the angel], will say, "This [record] is what is with me, prepared."
[Allah will say], "Throw into Hell every obstinate disbeliever,
Preventer of good, aggressor, and doubter,
Who made [as equal] with Allah another deity; then throw him into the severe punishment."
His [devil] companion will say, "Our Lord, I did not make him transgress, but he [himself] was in extreme error."
[Allah] will say, "Do not dispute before Me, while I had already presented to you the warning.
The word will not be changed with Me, and never will I be unjust to the servants."
On the Day We will say to Hell, "Have you been filled?" and it will say, "Are there some more,"
And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, not far,
[It will be said], "This is what you were promised - for every returner [to Allah] and keeper [of His covenant]
Who feared the Most Merciful unseen and came with a heart returning [in repentance].
Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eternity."
They will have whatever they wish therein, and with Us is more.
And how many a generation before them did We destroy who were greater than them in [striking] power and had explored throughout the lands. Is there any place of escape?
Indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present [in mind].
And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days, and there touched Us no weariness.
So be patient, [O Muhammad], over what they say and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting,
And [in part] of the night exalt Him and after prostration.
And listen on the Day when the Caller will call out from a place that is near -
The Day they will hear the blast [of the Horn] in truth. That is the Day of Emergence [from the graves].
Indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and to Us is the destination
On the Day the earth breaks away from them [and they emerge] rapidly; that is a gathering easy for Us.
We are most knowing of what they say, and you are not over them a tyrant. But remind by the Qur’an whoever fears My threat.
