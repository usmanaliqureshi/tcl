Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the verses of the clear Book.
Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an that you might understand.
We relate to you, [O Muhammad], the best of stories in what We have revealed to you of this Qur’an although you were, before it, among the unaware.
[Of these stories mention] when Joseph said to his father, "O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me."
He said, "O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan. Indeed Satan, to man, is a manifest enemy.
And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise."
Certainly were there in Joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask,
When they said, "Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a clan. Indeed, our father is in clear error.
Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance of your father will [then] be only for you, and you will be after that a righteous people."
Said a speaker among them, "Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up - if you would do [something]."
They said, "O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while indeed, we are to him sincere counselors?
Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play. And indeed, we will be his guardians.
[Jacob] said, "Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware."
They said, " If a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] clan, indeed, we would then be losers."
So when they took him [out] and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well... But We inspired to him, "You will surely inform them [someday] about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive [your identity]."
And they came to their father at night, weeping.
They said, "O our father, indeed we went racing each other and left Joseph with our possessions, and a wolf ate him. But you would not believe us, even if we were truthful."
And they brought upon his shirt false blood. [Jacob] said, "Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. And Allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe."
And there came a company of travelers; then they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, "Good news! Here is a boy." And they concealed him, [taking him] as merchandise; and Allah was knowing of what they did.
And they sold him for a reduced price - a few dirhams - and they were, concerning him, of those content with little.
And the one from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, "Make his residence comfortable. Perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son." And thus, We established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know.
And when Joseph reached maturity, We gave him judgment and knowledge. And thus We reward the doers of good.
And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, "Come, you." He said, "[I seek] the refuge of Allah. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed."
And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his Lord. And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants.
And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, "What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?"
[Joseph] said, "It was she who sought to seduce me." And a witness from her family testified. "If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars.
But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful."
So when her husband saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, "Indeed, it is of the women's plan. Indeed, your plan is great.
Joseph, ignore this. And, [my wife], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful."
And women in the city said, "The wife of al-‘Azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy; he has impassioned her with love. Indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error."
So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to Joseph], "Come out before them." And when they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said, "Perfect is Allah! This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel."
She said, "That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased."
He said, "My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant."
So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that al-‘Azeez should surely imprison him for a time.
And there entered the prison with him two young men. One of them said, "Indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] pressing wine." The other said, "Indeed, I have seen myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of those who do good."
He said, "You will not receive food that is provided to you except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers.
And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And it was not for us to associate anything with Allah. That is from the favor of Allah upon us and upon the people, but most of the people are not grateful.
O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Prevailing?
You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Legislation is not but for Allah. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.
O two companions of prison, as for one of you, he will give drink to his master of wine; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter has been decreed about which you both inquire."
And he said to the one whom he knew would go free, "Mention me before your master." But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master, and Joseph remained in prison several years.
And [subsequently] the king said, "Indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry. O eminent ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret visions."
They said, "[It is but] a mixture of false dreams, and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams."
But the one who was freed and remembered after a time said, "I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth."
[He said], "Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry - that I may return to the people; perhaps they will know [about you]."
[Joseph] said, "You will plant for seven years consecutively; and what you harvest leave in its spikes, except a little from which you will eat.
Then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will consume what you saved for them, except a little from which you will store.
Then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press [olives and grapes]."
And the king said, "Bring him to me." But when the messenger came to him, [Joseph] said, "Return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands. Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plan."
Said [the king to the women], "What was your condition when you sought to seduce Joseph?" They said, "Perfect is Allah! We know about him no evil." The wife of al-‘Azeez said, "Now the truth has become evident. It was I who sought to seduce him, and indeed, he is of the truthful.
That is so al-‘Azeez will know that I did not betray him in [his] absence and that Allah does not guide the plan of betrayers.
And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil, except those upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."
And the king said, "Bring him to me; I will appoint him exclusively for myself." And when he spoke to him, he said, "Indeed, you are today established [in position] and trusted."
[Joseph] said, "Appoint me over the storehouses of the land. Indeed, I will be a knowing guardian."
And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.
And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing Allah.
And the brothers of Joseph came [seeking food], and they entered upon him; and he recognized them, but he was to them unknown.
And when he had furnished them with their supplies, he said, "Bring me a brother of yours from your father. Do not you see that I give full measure and that I am the best of accommodators?
But if you do not bring him to me, no measure will there be [hereafter] for you from me, nor will you approach me."
They said, "We will attempt to dissuade his father from [keeping] him, and indeed, we will do [it]."
And [Joseph] said to his servants, "Put their merchandise into their saddlebags so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will [again] return."
So when they returned to their father, they said, "O our father, [further] measure has been denied to us, so send with us our brother [that] we will be given measure. And indeed, we will be his guardians."
He said, "Should I entrust you with him except [under coercion] as I entrusted you with his brother before? But Allah is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful."
And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said, "O our father, what [more] could we desire? This is our merchandise returned to us. And we will obtain supplies for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel's load; that is an easy measurement."
[Jacob] said, "Never will I send him with you until you give me a promise by Allah that you will bring him [back] to me, unless you should be surrounded by enemies." And when they had given their promise, he said, "Allah, over what we say, is Witness."
And he said, "O my sons, do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates; and I cannot avail you against [the decree of] Allah at all. The decision is only for Allah; upon Him I have relied, and upon Him let those who would rely [indeed] rely."
And when they entered from where their father had ordered them, it did not avail them against Allah at all except [it was] a need within the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And indeed, he was a possessor of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most of the people do not know.
And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself; he said, "Indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair over what they used to do [to me]."
So when he had furnished them with their supplies, he put the [gold measuring] bowl into the bag of his brother. Then an announcer called out, "O caravan, indeed you are thieves."
They said while approaching them, "What is it you are missing?"
They said, "We are missing the measure of the king. And for he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load, and I am responsible for it."
They said, "By Allah, you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves."
The accusers said, "Then what would be its recompense if you should be liars?"
[The brothers] said, "Its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found - he [himself] will be its recompense. Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers."
So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he extracted it from the bag of his brother. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother within the religion of the king except that Allah willed. We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing.
They said, "If he steals - a brother of his has stolen before." But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them. He said, "You are worse in position, and Allah is most knowing of what you describe."
They said, "O ‘Azeez, indeed he has a father [who is] an old man, so take one of us in place of him. Indeed, we see you as a doer of good."
He said, "[I seek] the refuge of Allah [to prevent] that we take except him with whom we found our possession. Indeed, we would then be unjust."
So when they had despaired of him, they secluded themselves in private consultation. The eldest of them said, "Do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by Allah and [that] before you failed in [your duty to] Joseph? So I will never leave [this] land until my father permits me or Allah decides for me, and He is the best of judges.
Return to your father and say, "O our father, indeed your son has stolen, and we did not testify except to what we knew. And we were not witnesses of the unseen,
And ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came - and indeed, we are truthful,"
[Jacob] said, "Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. Perhaps Allah will bring them to me all together. Indeed it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise."
And he turned away from them and said, "Oh, my sorrow over Joseph," and his eyes became white from grief, for he was [of that] a suppressor.
They said, "By Allah, you will not cease remembering Joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish."
He said, "I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you do not know.
O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from Allah. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allah except the disbelieving people."
So when they entered upon Joseph, they said, "O ‘Azeez, adversity has touched us and our family, and we have come with goods poor in quality, but give us full measure and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable."
He said, "Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?"
They said, "Are you indeed Joseph?" He said "I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has certainly favored us. Indeed, he who fears Allah and is patient, then indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good."
They said, "By Allah, certainly has Allah preferred you over us, and indeed, we have been sinners."
He said, "No blame will there be upon you today. Allah will forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful."
Take this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he will become seeing. And bring me your family, all together."
And when the caravan departed [from Egypt], their father said, "Indeed, I find the smell of Joseph [and would say that he was alive] if you did not think me weakened in mind."
They said, "By Allah, indeed you are in your [same] old error."
And when the bearer of good tidings arrived, he cast it over his face, and he returned [once again] seeing. He said, "Did I not tell you that I know from Allah that which you do not know?"
They said, "O our father, ask for us forgiveness of our sins; indeed, we have been sinners."
He said, "I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."
And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to himself and said, "Enter Egypt, Allah willing, safe [and secure]."
And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they bowed to him in prostration. And he said, "O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.
My Lord, You have given me [something] of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dreams. Creator of the heavens and earth, You are my protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous."
That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal, [O Muhammad], to you. And you were not with them when they put together their plan while they conspired.
And most of the people, although you strive [for it], are not believers.
And you do not ask of them for it any payment. It is not except a reminder to the worlds.
And how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they, therefrom, are turning away.
And most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with Him.
Then do they feel secure that there will not come to them an overwhelming [aspect] of the punishment of Allah or that the Hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive?
Say, "This is my way; I invite to Allah with insight, I and those who follow me. And exalted is Allah; and I am not of those who associate others with Him."
And We sent not before you [as messengers] except men to whom We revealed from among the people of cities. So have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? And the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah; then will you not reason?
[They continued] until, when the messengers despaired and were certain that they had been denied, there came to them Our victory, and whoever We willed was saved. And Our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals.
There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding. Never was the Qur’an a narration invented, but a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe.
Alif, Lam, Meem, Ra. These are the verses of the Book; and what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most of the people do not believe.
It is Allah who erected the heavens without pillars that you [can] see; then He established Himself above the Throne and made subject the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term. He arranges [each] matter; He details the signs that you may, of the meeting with your Lord, be certain.
And it is He who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set mountains and rivers; and from all of the fruits He made therein two mates; He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.
And within the land are neighboring plots and gardens of grapevines and crops and palm trees, [growing] several from a root or otherwise, watered with one water; but We make some of them exceed others in [quality of] fruit. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason.
And if you are astonished, [O Muhammad] - then astonishing is their saying, "When we are dust, will we indeed be [brought] into a new creation?" Those are the ones who have disbelieved in their Lord, and those will have shackles upon their necks, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.
They impatiently urge you to bring about evil before good, while there has already occurred before them similar punishments [to what they demand]. And indeed, your Lord is full of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing, and indeed, your Lord is severe in penalty.
And those who disbelieved say, "Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?" You are only a warner, and for every people is a guide.
Allah knows what every female carries and what the wombs lose [prematurely] or exceed. And everything with Him is by due measure.
[He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Grand, the Exalted.
It is the same [to Him] concerning you whether one conceals [his] speech or one publicizes it and whether one is hidden by night or conspicuous [among others] by day.
For each one are successive [angels] before and behind him who protect him by the decree of Allah. Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. And when Allah intends for a people ill, there is no repelling it. And there is not for them besides Him any patron.
It is He who shows you lightening, [causing] fear and aspiration, and generates the heavy clouds.
And the thunder exalts [Allah] with praise of Him - and the angels [as well] from fear of Him - and He sends thunderbolts and strikes therewith whom He wills while they dispute about Allah; and He is severe in assault.
To Him [alone] is the supplication of truth. And those they call upon besides Him do not respond to them with a thing, except as one who stretches his hands toward water [from afar, calling it] to reach his mouth, but it will not reach it [thus]. And the supplication of the disbelievers is not but in error [i.e. futility].
And to Allah prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth, willingly or by compulsion, and their shadows [as well] in the mornings and the afternoons.
Say, "Who is Lord of the heavens and earth?" Say, "Allah." Say, "Have you then taken besides Him allies not possessing [even] for themselves any benefit or any harm?" Say, "Is the blind equivalent to the seeing? Or is darkness equivalent to light? Or have they attributed to Allah partners who created like His creation so that the creation [of each] seemed similar to them?" Say, "Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Prevailing."
He sends down from the sky, rain, and valleys flow according to their capacity, and the torrent carries a rising foam. And from that [ore] which they heat in the fire, desiring adornments and utensils, is a foam like it. Thus Allah presents [the example of] truth and falsehood. As for the foam, it vanishes, [being] cast off; but as for that which benefits the people, it remains on the earth. Thus does Allah present examples.
For those who have responded to their Lord is the best [reward], but those who did not respond to Him - if they had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it, they would [attempt to] ransom themselves thereby. Those will have the worst account, and their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place.
Then is he who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth like one who is blind? They will only be reminded who are people of understanding -
Those who fulfill the covenant of Allah and do not break the contract,
And those who join that which Allah has ordered to be joined and fear their Lord and are afraid of the evil of [their] account,
And those who are patient, seeking the countenance of their Lord, and establish prayer and spend from what We have provided for them secretly and publicly and prevent evil with good - those will have the good consequence of [this] home -
Gardens of perpetual residence; they will enter them with whoever were righteous among their fathers, their spouses and their descendants. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, [saying],
"Peace be upon you for what you patiently endured. And excellent is the final home."
But those who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and spread corruption on earth - for them is the curse, and they will have the worst home.
Allah extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. And they rejoice in the worldly life, while the worldly life is not, compared to the Hereafter, except [brief] enjoyment.
And those who disbelieved say, "Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?" Say, [O Muhammad], "Indeed, Allah leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him] -
Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured."
Those who have believed and done righteous deeds - a good state is theirs and a good return.
Thus have We sent you to a community before which [other] communities have passed on so you might recite to them that which We revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Merciful. Say, "He is my Lord; there is no deity except Him. Upon Him I rely, and to Him is my return."
And if there was any qur’an by which the mountains would be removed or the earth would be broken apart or the dead would be made to speak, [it would be this Qur’an], but to Allah belongs the affair entirely. Then have those who believed not accepted that had Allah willed, He would have guided the people, all of them? And those who disbelieve do not cease to be struck, for what they have done, by calamity - or it will descend near their home - until there comes the promise of Allah. Indeed, Allah does not fail in [His] promise.
And already were [other] messengers ridiculed before you, and I extended the time of those who disbelieved; then I seized them, and how [terrible] was My penalty.
Then is He who is a maintainer of every soul, [knowing] what it has earned, [like any other]? But to Allah they have attributed partners. Say, "Name them. Or do you inform Him of that which He knows not upon the earth or of what is apparent of speech?" Rather, their [own] plan has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they have been averted from the way. And whomever Allah leaves astray - there will be for him no guide.
For them will be punishment in the life of [this] world, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe. And they will not have from Allah any protector.
The example of Paradise, which the righteous have been promised, is [that] beneath it rivers flow. Its fruit is lasting, and its shade. That is the consequence for the righteous, and the consequence for the disbelievers is the Fire.
And [the believers among] those to whom We have given the [previous] Scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], but among the [opposing] factions are those who deny part of it. Say, "I have only been commanded to worship Allah and not associate [anything] with Him. To Him I invite, and to Him is my return."
And thus We have revealed it as an Arabic legislation. And if you should follow their inclinations after what has come to you of knowledge, you would not have against Allah any ally or any protector.
And We have already sent messengers before you and assigned to them wives and descendants. And it was not for a messenger to come with a sign except by permission of Allah. For every term is a decree.
Allah eliminates what He wills or confirms, and with Him is the Mother of the Book.
And whether We show you part of what We promise them or take you in death, upon you is only the [duty of] notification, and upon Us is the account.
Have they not seen that We set upon the land, reducing it from its borders? And Allah decides; there is no adjuster of His decision. And He is swift in account.
And those before them had plotted, but to Allah belongs the plan entirely. He knows what every soul earns, and the disbelievers will know for whom is the final home.
And those who have disbelieved say, "You are not a messenger." Say, [O Muhammad], "Sufficient is Allah as Witness between me and you, and [the witness of] whoever has knowledge of the Scripture."
Alif, Lam, Ra. [This is] a Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that you might bring mankind out of darknesses into the light by permission of their Lord - to the path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy -
Allah, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And woe to the disbelievers from a severe punishment
The ones who prefer the worldly life over the Hereafter and avert [people] from the way of Allah, seeking to make it (seem) deviant. Those are in extreme error.
And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and Allah sends astray [thereby] whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs, [saying], "Bring out your people from darknesses into the light and remind them of the days of Allah." Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.
And [recall, O Children of Israel], when Moses said to His people, "Remember the favor of Allah upon you when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst torment and were slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, 'If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]; but if you deny, indeed, My punishment is severe.' "
And Moses said, "If you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely - indeed, Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy."
Has there not reached you the news of those before you - the people of Noah and ‘Aad and Thamud and those after them? No one knows them but Allah. Their messengers brought them clear proofs, but they returned their hands to their mouths and said, "Indeed, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and indeed we are, about that to which you invite us, in disquieting doubt."
Their messengers said, "Can there be doubt about Allah, Creator of the heavens and earth? He invites you that He may forgive you of your sins, and He delays your death for a specified term." They said, "You are not but men like us who wish to avert us from what our fathers were worshipping. So bring us a clear authority."
Their messengers said to them, "We are only men like you, but Allah confers favor upon whom He wills of His servants. It has never been for us to bring you evidence except by permission of Allah. And upon Allah let the believers rely.
And why should we not rely upon Allah while He has guided us to our [good] ways. And we will surely be patient against whatever harm you should cause us. And upon Allah let those who would rely [indeed] rely."
And those who disbelieved said to their messengers, "We will surely drive you out of our land, or you must return to our religion." So their Lord inspired to them, "We will surely destroy the wrongdoers.
And We will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them. That is for he who fears My position and fears My threat."
And they requested victory from Allah, and disappointed, [therefore], was every obstinate tyrant.
Before him is Hell, and he will be given a drink of purulent water.
He will gulp it but will hardly [be able to] swallow it. And death will come to him from everywhere, but he is not to die. And before him is a massive punishment.
The example of those who disbelieve in their Lord is [that] their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day; they are unable [to keep] from what they earned a [single] thing. That is what is extreme error.
Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth? If He wills, He can do away with you and produce a new creation.
And that is not difficult for Allah.
And they will come out [for judgement] before Allah all together, and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, "Indeed, we were your followers, so can you avail us anything against the punishment of Allah?" They will say, "If Allah had guided us, we would have guided you. It is all the same for us whether we show intolerance or are patient: there is for us no place of escape."
And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, "Indeed, Allah had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; but blame yourselves. I cannot be called to your aid, nor can you be called to my aid. Indeed, I deny your association of me [with Allah] before. Indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment."
And those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein by permission of their Lord; and their greeting therein will be, "Peace!"
Have you not considered how Allah presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?
It produces its fruit all the time, by permission of its Lord. And Allah presents examples for the people that perhaps they will be reminded.
And the example of a bad word is like a bad tree, uprooted from the surface of the earth, not having any stability.
Allah keeps firm those who believe, with the firm word, in worldly life and in the Hereafter. And Allah sends astray the wrongdoers. And Allah does what He wills.
Have you not considered those who exchanged the favor of Allah for disbelief and settled their people [in] the home of ruin?
[It is] Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the settlement.
And they have attributed to Allah equals to mislead [people] from His way. Say, "Enjoy yourselves, for indeed, your destination is the Fire."
[O Muhammad], tell My servants who have believed to establish prayer and spend from what We have provided them, secretly and publicly, before a Day comes in which there will be no exchange, nor any friendships.
It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by His command and subjected for you the rivers.
And He subjected for you the sun and the moon, continuous [in orbit], and subjected for you the night and the day.
And He gave you from all you asked of Him. And if you should count the favor of Allah, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful.
And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city [Makkah] secure and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.
My Lord, indeed they have led astray many among the people. So whoever follows me - then he is of me; and whoever disobeys me - indeed, You are [yet] Forgiving and Merciful.
Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful.
Our Lord, indeed You know what we conceal and what we declare, and nothing is hidden from Allah on the earth or in the heaven.
Praise to Allah, who has granted to me in old age Ishmael and Isaac. Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of supplication.
My Lord, make me an establisher of prayer, and [many] from my descendants. Our Lord, and accept my supplication.
Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and the believers the Day the account is established."
And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror].
Racing ahead, their heads raised up, their glance does not come back to them, and their hearts are void.
And, [O Muhammad], warn the people of a Day when the punishment will come to them and those who did wrong will say, "Our Lord, delay us for a short term; we will answer Your call and follow the messengers." [But it will be said], "Had you not sworn, before, that for you there would be no cessation?
And you lived among the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it had become clear to you how We dealt with them. And We presented for you [many] examples."
And they had planned their plan, but with Allah is [recorded] their plan, even if their plan had been [sufficient] to do away with the mountains.
So never think that Allah will fail in His promise to His messengers. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution.
[It will be] on the Day the earth will be replaced by another earth, and the heavens [as well], and all creatures will come out before Allah, the One, the Prevailing.
And you will see the criminals that Day bound together in shackles,
Their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the Fire.
So that Allah will recompense every soul for what it earned. Indeed, Allah is swift in account.
This [Qur’an] is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is but one God and that those of understanding will be reminded.
Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the verses of the Book and a clear Qur’an.
Perhaps those who disbelieve will wish that they had been Muslims.
Let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by [false] hope, for they are going to know.
And We did not destroy any city but that for it was a known decree.
No nation will precede its term, nor will they remain thereafter.
And they say," O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad.
Why do you not bring us the angels, if you should be among the truthful?"
We do not send down the angels except with truth; and the disbelievers would not then be reprieved.
Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an and indeed, We will be its guardian.
And We had certainly sent [messengers] before you, [O Muhammad], among the sects of the former peoples.
And no messenger would come to them except that they ridiculed him.
Thus do We insert denial into the hearts of the criminals.
They will not believe in it, while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples.
And [even] if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they continued therein to ascend,
They would say, "Our eyes have only been dazzled. Rather, we are a people affected by magic."
And We have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers.
And We have protected it from every devil expelled [from the mercy of Allah]
Except one who steals a hearing and is pursued by a clear burning flame.
And the earth - We have spread it and cast therein firmly set mountains and caused to grow therein [something] of every well-balanced thing.
And We have made for you therein means of living and [for] those for whom you are not providers.
And there is not a thing but that with Us are its depositories, and We do not send it down except according to a known measure.
And We have sent the fertilizing winds and sent down water from the sky and given you drink from it. And you are not its retainers.
And indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritor.
And We have already known the preceding [generations] among you, and We have already known the later [ones to come].
And indeed, your Lord will gather them; indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.
And We did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud.
And the jinn We created before from scorching fire.
And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "I will create a human being out of clay from an altered black mud.
And when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration."
So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely,
Except Iblees, he refused to be with those who prostrated.
[Allah] said, O Iblees, what is [the matter] with you that you are not with those who prostrate?"
He said, "Never would I prostrate to a human whom You created out of clay from an altered black mud."
[Allah] said, "Then get out of it, for indeed, you are expelled.
And indeed, upon you is the curse until the Day of Recompense."
He said," My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected."
[Allah] said, "So indeed, you are of those reprieved
Until the Day of the time well-known."
[Iblees] said, "My Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely make [disobedience] attractive to them on earth, and I will mislead them all
Except, among them, Your chosen servants."
[Allah] said, "This is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight.
Indeed, My servants - no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.
And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all.
It has seven gates; for every gate is of them a portion designated."
Indeed, the righteous will be within gardens and springs.
[Having been told], "Enter it in peace, safe [and secure]."
And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, [so they will be] brothers, on thrones facing each other.
No fatigue will touch them therein, nor from it will they [ever] be removed.
[O Muhammad], inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful.
And that it is My punishment which is the painful punishment.
And inform them about the guests of Abraham,
When they entered upon him and said, "Peace." [Abraham] said, "Indeed, we are fearful of you."
[The angels] said, "Fear not. Indeed, we give you good tidings of a learned boy."
He said, "Have you given me good tidings although old age has come upon me? Then of what [wonder] do you inform?"
They said, "We have given you good tidings in truth, so do not be of the despairing."
He said, "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those astray?"
[Abraham] said, "Then what is your business [here], O messengers?"
They said, "Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals,
Except the family of Lot; indeed, we will save them all
Except his wife." Allah decreed that she is of those who remain behind.
And when the messengers came to the family of Lot,
He said, "Indeed, you are people unknown."
They said, "But we have come to you with that about which they were disputing,
And we have come to you with truth, and indeed, we are truthful.
So set out with your family during a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back and continue on to where you are commanded."
And We conveyed to him [the decree] of that matter: that those [sinners] would be eliminated by early morning.
And the people of the city came rejoicing.
[Lot] said, "Indeed, these are my guests, so do not shame me.
And fear Allah and do not disgrace me."
They said, "Have we not forbidden you from [protecting] people?"
[Lot] said, "These are my daughters - if you would be doers [of lawful marriage]."
By your life, [O Muhammad], indeed they were, in their intoxication, wandering blindly.
So the shriek seized them at sunrise.
And We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay.
Indeed in that are signs for those who discern.
And indeed, those cities are [situated] on an established road.
Indeed in that is a sign for the believers.
And the companions of the thicket were [also] wrongdoers.
So We took retribution from them, and indeed, both [cities] are on a clear highway.
And certainly did the companions of Thamud deny the messengers.
And We gave them Our signs, but from them they were turning away.
And they used to carve from the mountains, houses, feeling secure.
But the shriek seized them at early morning.
So nothing availed them [from] what they used to earn.
And We have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth. And indeed, the Hour is coming; so forgive with gracious forgiveness.
Indeed, your Lord - He is the Knowing Creator.
And We have certainly given you, [O Muhammad], seven of the often repeated [verses] and the great Qur’an.
Do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [certain] categories of the disbelievers, and do not grieve over them. And lower your wing to the believers
And say, "Indeed, I am the clear warner" -
Just as We had revealed [scriptures] to the separators
Who have made the Qur’an into portions.
So by your Lord, We will surely question them all
About what they used to do.
Then declare what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists.
Indeed, We are sufficient for you against the mockers
Who make [equal] with Allah another deity. But they are going to know.
And We already know that your breast is constrained by what they say.
So exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord and be of those who prostrate [to Him].
And worship your Lord until there comes to you the certainty (death).
The command of Allah is coming, so be not impatient for it. Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.
He sends down the angels, with the inspiration of His command, upon whom He wills of His servants, [telling them], "Warn that there is no deity except Me; so fear Me."
He created the heavens and earth in truth. High is He above what they associate with Him.
He created man from a sperm-drop; then at once, he is a clear adversary.
And the grazing livestock He has created for you; in them is warmth and [numerous] benefits, and from them you eat.
And for you in them is [the enjoyment of] beauty when you bring them in [for the evening] and when you send them out [to pasture].
And they carry your loads to a land you could not have reached except with difficulty to yourselves. Indeed, your Lord is Kind and Merciful.
And [He created] the horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride and [as] adornment. And He creates that which you do not know.
And upon Allah is the direction of the [right] way, and among the various paths are those deviating. And if He willed, He could have guided you all.
It is He who sends down rain from the sky; from it is drink and from it is foliage in which you pasture [animals].
He causes to grow for you thereby the crops, olives, palm trees, grapevines, and from all the fruits. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought.
And He has subjected for you the night and day and the sun and moon, and the stars are subjected by His command. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason.
And [He has subjected] whatever He multiplied for you on the earth of varying colors. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who remember.
And it is He who subjected the sea for you to eat from it tender meat and to extract from it ornaments which you wear. And you see the ships plowing through it, and [He subjected it] that you may seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be grateful.
And He has cast into the earth firmly set mountains, lest it shift with you, and [made] rivers and roads, that you may be guided,
And landmarks. And by the stars they are [also] guided.
Then is He who creates like one who does not create? So will you not be reminded?
And if you should count the favors of Allah, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And Allah knows what you conceal and what you declare.
And those they invoke other than Allah create nothing, and they [themselves] are created.
They are, [in fact], dead, not alive, and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected.
Your god is one God. But those who do not believe in the Hereafter - their hearts are disapproving, and they are arrogant.
Assuredly, Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare. Indeed, He does not like the arrogant.
And when it is said to them, "What has your Lord sent down?" They say, "Legends of the former peoples,"
That they may bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection and some of the burdens of those whom they misguide without knowledge. Unquestionably, evil is that which they bear.
Those before them had already plotted, but Allah came at their building from the foundations, so the roof fell upon them from above them, and the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive.
Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and say, "Where are My 'partners' for whom you used to oppose [the believers]?" Those who were given knowledge will say, "Indeed disgrace, this Day, and evil are upon the disbelievers" -
The ones whom the angels take in death [while] wronging themselves, and [who] then offer submission, [saying], "We were not doing any evil." But, yes! Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what you used to do.
So enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and how wretched is the residence of the arrogant.
And it will be said to those who feared Allah, "What did your Lord send down?" They will say, "[That which is] good." For those who do good in this world is good; and the home of the Hereafter is better. And how excellent is the home of the righteous -
Gardens of perpetual residence, which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow. They will have therein whatever they wish. Thus does Allah reward the righteous -
The ones whom the angels take in death, [being] good and pure; [the angels] will say, "Peace be upon you. Enter Paradise for what you used to do."
Do the disbelievers await [anything] except that the angels should come to them or there comes the command of your Lord? Thus did those do before them. And Allah wronged them not, but they had been wronging themselves.
So they were struck by the evil consequences of what they did and were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
And those who associate others with Allah say, "If Allah had willed, we would not have worshipped anything other than Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything through other than Him." Thus did those do before them. So is there upon the messengers except [the duty of] clear notification?
And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], "Worship Allah and avoid Taghut." And among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.
[Even] if you should strive for their guidance, [O Muhammad], indeed, Allah does not guide those He sends astray, and they will have no helpers.
And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths [that] Allah will not resurrect one who dies. But yes - [it is] a true promise [binding] upon Him, but most of the people do not know.
[It is] so He will make clear to them [the truth of] that wherein they differ and so those who have disbelieved may know that they were liars.
Indeed, Our word to a thing when We intend it is but that We say to it, "Be," and it is.
And those who emigrated for [the cause of] Allah after they had been wronged - We will surely settle them in this world in a good place; but the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if only they could know.
[They are] those who endured patiently and upon their Lord relied.
And We sent not before you except men to whom We revealed [Our message]. So ask the people of the message if you do not know.
[We sent them] with clear proofs and written ordinances. And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought.
Then, do those who have planned evil deeds feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive?
Or that He would not seize them during their [usual] activity, and they could not cause failure?
Or that He would not seize them gradually [in a state of dread]? But indeed, your Lord is Kind and Merciful.
Have they not considered what things Allah has created? Their shadows incline to the right and to the left, prostrating to Allah, while they are humble.
And to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of creatures, and the angels [as well], and they are not arrogant.
They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.
And Allah has said, "Do not take for yourselves two deities. He is but one God, so fear only Me."
And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is [due] worship constantly. Then is it other than Allah that you fear?
And whatever you have of favor - it is from Allah. Then when adversity touches you, to Him you cry for help.
Then when He removes the adversity from you, at once a party of you associates others with their Lord
So they will deny what We have given them. Then enjoy yourselves, for you are going to know.
And they assign to what they do not know a portion of that which We have provided them. By Allah, you will surely be questioned about what you used to invent.
And they attribute to Allah daughters - exalted is He - and for them is what they desire.
And when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.
He hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground? Unquestionably, evil is what they decide.
For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is the description of evil; and for Allah is the highest attribute. And He is Exalted in Might, the Wise.
And if Allah were to impose blame on the people for their wrongdoing, He would not have left upon the earth any creature, but He defers them for a specified term. And when their term has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it].
And they attribute to Allah that which they dislike, and their tongues assert the lie that they will have the best [from Him]. Assuredly, they will have the Fire, and they will be [therein] neglected.
By Allah, We did certainly send [messengers] to nations before you, but Satan made their deeds attractive to them. And he is the disbelievers’ ally today [as well], and they will have a painful punishment.
And We have not revealed to you the Book, [O Muhammad], except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe.
And Allah has sent down rain from the sky and given life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who listen.
And indeed, for you in grazing livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from what is in their bellies - between excretion and blood - pure milk, palatable to drinkers.
And from the fruits of the palm trees and grapevines you take intoxicant and good provision. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who reason.
And your Lord inspired to the bee, "Take for yourself among the mountains, houses, and among the trees and [in] that which they construct.
Then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you]." There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought.
And Allah created you; then He will take you in death. And among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit [old] age so that he will not know, after [having had] knowledge, a thing. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Competent.
And Allah has favored some of you over others in provision. But those who were favored would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess so they would be equal to them therein. Then is it the favor of Allah they reject?
And Allah has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things. Then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of Allah they disbelieve?
And they worship besides Allah that which does not possess for them [the power of] provision from the heavens and the earth at all, and [in fact], they are unable.
So do not assert similarities to Allah. Indeed, Allah knows and you do not know.
Allah presents an example: a slave [who is] owned and unable to do a thing and he to whom We have provided from Us good provision, so he spends from it secretly and publicly. Can they be equal? Praise to Allah! But most of them do not know.
And Allah presents an example of two men, one of them dumb and unable to do a thing, while he is a burden to his guardian. Wherever he directs him, he brings no good. Is he equal to one who commands justice, while he is on a straight path?
And to Allah belongs the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. And the command for the Hour is not but as a glance of the eye or even nearer. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.
And Allah has extracted you from the wombs of your mothers not knowing a thing, and He made for you hearing and vision and intellect that perhaps you would be grateful.
Do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky? None holds them up except Allah. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
And Allah has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals tents which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment; and from their wool, fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for a time.
And Allah has made for you, from that which He has created, shadows and has made for you from the mountains, shelters and has made for you garments which protect you from the heat and garments which protect you from your [enemy in] battle. Thus does He complete His favor upon you that you might submit [to Him].
But if they turn away, [O Muhammad] - then only upon you is [responsibility for] clear notification.
They recognize the favor of Allah; then they deny it. And most of them are disbelievers.
And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect from every nation a witness. Then it will not be permitted to the disbelievers [to apologize or make excuses], nor will they be asked to appease [Allah].
And when those who wronged see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.
And when those who associated others with Allah see their "partners," they will say," Our Lord, these are our partners [to You] whom we used to invoke besides You." But they will throw at them the statement, "Indeed, you are liars."
And they will impart to Allah that Day [their] submission, and lost from them is what they used to invent.
Those who disbelieved and averted [others] from the way of Allah - We will increase them in punishment over [their] punishment for what corruption they were causing.
And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect among every nation a witness over them from themselves. And We will bring you, [O Muhammad], as a witness over your nation. And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims.
Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded.
And fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have taken it, [O believers], and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made Allah, over you, a witness. Indeed, Allah knows what you do.
And do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it was strong [by] taking your oaths as [means of] deceit between you because one community is more plentiful [in number or wealth] than another community. Allah only tries you thereby. And He will surely make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that over which you used to differ.
And if Allah had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.
And do not take your oaths as [means of] deceit between you, lest a foot slip after it was [once] firm, and you would taste evil [in this world] for what [people] you diverted from the way of Allah, and you would have [in the Hereafter] a great punishment.
And do not exchange the covenant of Allah for a small price. Indeed, what is with Allah is best for you, if only you could know.
Whatever you have will end, but what Allah has is lasting. And We will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do.
Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.
So when you recite the Qur’an, [first] seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the expelled [from His mercy].
Indeed, there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their Lord.
His authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with Allah.
And when We substitute a verse in place of a verse - and Allah is most knowing of what He sends down - they say, "You, [O Muhammad], are but an inventor [of lies]." But most of them do not know.
Say, [O Muhammad], "The Pure Spirit has brought it down from your Lord in truth to make firm those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to the Muslims."
And We certainly know that they say, "It is only a human being who teaches the Prophet." The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, and this Qur’an is [in] a clear Arabic language.
Indeed, those who do not believe in the verses of Allah - Allah will not guide them, and for them is a painful punishment.
They only invent falsehood who do not believe in the verses of Allah, and it is those who are the liars.
Whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief... except for one who is forced [to renounce his religion] while his heart is secure in faith. But those who [willingly] open their breasts to disbelief, upon them is wrath from Allah, and for them is a great punishment;
That is because they preferred the worldly life over the Hereafter and that Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
Those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision Allah has sealed, and it is those who are the heedless.
Assuredly, it is they, in the Hereafter, who will be the losers.
Then, indeed your Lord, to those who emigrated after they had been compelled [to renounce their religion] and thereafter fought [for the cause of Allah] and were patient - indeed, your Lord, after that, is Forgiving and Merciful
On the Day when every soul will come disputing for itself, and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and they will not be wronged.
And Allah presents an example: a city which was safe and secure, its provision coming to it in abundance from every location, but it denied the favors of Allah. So Allah made it taste the envelopment of hunger and fear for what they had been doing.
And there had certainly come to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they denied him; so punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers.
Then eat of what Allah has provided for you [which is] lawful and good. And be grateful for the favor of Allah, if it is [indeed] Him that you worship.
He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit] - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth, "This is lawful and this is unlawful," to invent falsehood about Allah. Indeed, those who invent falsehood about Allah will not succeed.
[It is but] a brief enjoyment, and they will have a painful punishment.
And to those who are Jews We have prohibited that which We related to you before. And We did not wrong them [thereby], but they were wronging themselves.
Then, indeed your Lord, to those who have done wrong out of ignorance and then repent after that and correct themselves - indeed, your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.
Indeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader, devoutly obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah.
[He was] grateful for His favors. Allah chose him and guided him to a straight path.
And We gave him good in this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of those who associate with Allah.
The sabbath was only appointed for those who differed over it. And indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.
Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.
And if you punish [an enemy, O believers], punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed. But if you are patient - it is better for those who are patient.
And be patient, [O Muhammad], and your patience is not but through Allah. And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire.
Indeed, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good.
Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing.
And We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel that you not take other than Me as Disposer of affairs,
O descendants of those We carried [in the ship] with Noah. Indeed, he was a grateful servant.
And We conveyed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture that, "You will surely cause corruption on the earth twice, and you will surely reach [a degree of] great haughtiness.
So when the [time of] promise came for the first of them, We sent against you servants of Ours - those of great military might, and they probed [even] into the homes, and it was a promise fulfilled.
Then We gave back to you a return victory over them. And We reinforced you with wealth and sons and made you more numerous in manpower
[And said], "If you do good, you do good for yourselves; and if you do evil, [you do it] to yourselves." Then when the final promise came, [We sent your enemies] to sadden your faces and to enter the temple in Jerusalem, as they entered it the first time, and to destroy what they had taken over with [total] destruction.
[Then Allah said], "It is expected, [if you repent], that your Lord will have mercy upon you. But if you return [to sin], We will return [to punishment]. And We have made Hell, for the disbelievers, a prison-bed."
Indeed, this Qur’an guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward.
And that those who do not believe in the Hereafter - We have prepared for them a painful punishment.
And man supplicates for evil as he supplicates for good, and man is ever hasty.
And We have made the night and day two signs, and We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible that you may seek bounty from your Lord and may know the number of years and the account [of time]. And everything We have set out in detail.
And [for] every person We have imposed his fate upon his neck, and We will produce for him on the Day of Resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open.
[It will be said], "Read your record. Sufficient is yourself against you this Day as accountant."
Whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul. And whoever errs only errs against it. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And never would We punish until We sent a messenger.
And when We intend to destroy a city, We command its affluent but they defiantly disobey therein; so the word comes into effect upon it, and We destroy it with [complete] destruction.
And how many have We destroyed from the generations after Noah. And sufficient is your Lord, concerning the sins of His servants, as Acquainted and Seeing.
Whoever should desire the immediate - We hasten for him from it what We will to whom We intend. Then We have made for him Hell, which he will [enter to] burn, censured and banished.
But whoever desires the Hereafter and exerts the effort due to it while he is a believer - it is those whose effort is ever appreciated [by Allah].
To each [category] We extend - to these and to those - from the gift of your Lord. And never has the gift of your Lord been restricted.
Look how We have favored [in provision] some of them over others. But the Hereafter is greater in degrees [of difference] and greater in distinction.
Do not make [as equal] with Allah another deity and [thereby] become censured and forsaken.
And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], "uff," and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word.
And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, "My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small."
Your Lord is most knowing of what is within yourselves. If you should be righteous [in intention] - then indeed He is ever, to the often returning [to Him], Forgiving.
And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully.
Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful.
And if you [must] turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your Lord which you expect, then speak to them a gentle word.
And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck or extend it completely and [thereby] become blamed and insolvent.
Indeed, your Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. Indeed He is ever, concerning His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.
And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin.
And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.
And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right. And whoever is killed unjustly - We have given his heir authority, but let him not exceed limits in [the matter of] taking life. Indeed, he has been supported [by the law].
And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best, until he reaches maturity. And fulfill [every] commitment. Indeed, the commitment is ever [that about which one will be] questioned.
And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is the best [way] and best in result.
And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned.
And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height.
All that - its evil is ever, in the sight of your Lord, detested.
That is from what your Lord has revealed to you, [O Muhammad], of wisdom. And, [O mankind], do not make [as equal] with Allah another deity, lest you be thrown into Hell, blamed and banished.
Then, has your Lord chosen you for [having] sons and taken from among the angels daughters? Indeed, you say a grave saying.
And We have certainly diversified [the contents] in this Qur’an that mankind may be reminded, but it does not increase the disbelievers except in aversion.
Say, [O Muhammad], "If there had been with Him [other] gods, as they say, then they [each] would have sought to the Owner of the Throne a way."
Exalted is He and high above what they say by great sublimity.
The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [Allah] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving.
And when you recite the Qur’an, We put between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter a concealed partition.
And We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Qur’an, they turn back in aversion.
We are most knowing of how they listen to it when they listen to you and [of] when they are in private conversation, when the wrongdoers say, "You follow not but a man affected by magic."
Look how they strike for you comparisons; but they have strayed, so they cannot [find] a way.
And they say, "When we are bones and crumbled particles, will we [truly] be resurrected as a new creation?"
Say, "Be you stones or iron
Or [any] creation of that which is great within your breasts." And they will say, "Who will restore us?" Say, "He who brought you forth the first time." Then they will nod their heads toward you and say, "When is that?" Say, "Perhaps it will be soon -
On the Day He will call you and you will respond with praise of Him and think that you had not remained [in the world] except for a little."
And tell My servants to say that which is best. Indeed, Satan induces [dissension] among them. Indeed Satan is ever, to mankind, a clear enemy.
Your Lord is most knowing of you. If He wills, He will have mercy upon you; or if He wills, He will punish you. And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], over them as a manager.
And your Lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And We have made some of the prophets exceed others [in various ways], and to David We gave the book [of Psalms].
Say, "Invoke those you have claimed [as gods] besides Him, for they do not possess the [ability for] removal of adversity from you or [for its] transfer [to someone else]."
Those whom they invoke seek means of access to their Lord, [striving as to] which of them would be nearest, and they hope for His mercy and fear His punishment. Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is ever feared.
And there is no city but that We will destroy it before the Day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment. That has ever been in the Register inscribed.
And nothing has prevented Us from sending signs except that the former peoples denied them. And We gave Thamud the she-camel as a visible sign, but they wronged her. And We send not the signs except as a warning.
And [remember, O Muhammad], when We told you, "Indeed, your Lord has encompassed the people." And We did not make the sight which We showed you except as a trial for the people, as was the accursed tree [mentioned] in the Qur’an. And We threaten them, but it increases them not except in great transgression.
And [mention] when We said to the angles, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He said, "Should I prostrate to one You created from clay?"
[Iblees] said, "Do You see this one whom You have honored above me? If You delay me until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely destroy his descendants, except for a few."
[Allah] said, "Go, for whoever of them follows you, indeed Hell will be the recompense of you - an ample recompense.
And incite [to senselessness] whoever you can among them with your voice and assault them with your horses and foot soldiers and become a partner in their wealth and their children and promise them." But Satan does not promise them except delusion.
Indeed, over My [believing] servants there is for you no authority. And sufficient is your Lord as Disposer of affairs.
It is your Lord who drives the ship for you through the sea that you may seek of His bounty. Indeed, He is ever, to you, Merciful.
And when adversity touches you at sea, lost are [all] those you invoke except for Him. But when He delivers you to the land, you turn away [from Him]. And ever is man ungrateful.
Then do you feel secure that [instead] He will not cause a part of the land to swallow you or send against you a storm of stones? Then you would not find for yourselves an advocate.
Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back into the sea another time and send upon you a hurricane of wind and drown you for what you denied? Then you would not find for yourselves against Us an avenger.
And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what We have created, with [definite] preference.
[Mention, O Muhammad], the Day We will call forth every people with their record [of deeds]. Then whoever is given his record in his right hand - those will read their records, and injustice will not be done to them, [even] as much as a thread [inside the date seed].
And whoever is blind in this [life] will be blind in the Hereafter and more astray in way.
And indeed, they were about to tempt you away from that which We revealed to you in order to [make] you invent about Us something else; and then they would have taken you as a friend.
And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little.
Then [if you had], We would have made you taste double [punishment in] life and double [after] death. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.
And indeed, they were about to drive you from the land to evict you therefrom. And then [when they do], they will not remain [there] after you, except for a little.
[That is Our] established way for those We had sent before you of Our messengers; and you will not find in Our way any alteration.
Establish prayer at the decline of the sun [from its meridian] until the darkness of the night and [also] the Qur’an of dawn. Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed.
And from [part of] the night, pray with it as additional [worship] for you; it is expected that your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station.
And say, "My Lord, cause me to enter a sound entrance and to exit a sound exit and grant me from Yourself a supporting authority."
And say, "Truth has come, and falsehood has departed. Indeed is falsehood, [by nature], ever bound to depart."
And We send down of the Qur’an that which is healing and mercy for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.
And when We bestow favor upon the disbeliever, he turns away and distances himself; and when evil touches him, he is ever despairing.
Say, "Each works according to his manner, but your Lord is most knowing of who is best guided in way."
And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the soul. Say, "The soul is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind have not been given of knowledge except a little."
And if We willed, We could surely do away with that which We revealed to you. Then you would not find for yourself concerning it an advocate against Us.
Except [We have left it with you] as a mercy from your Lord. Indeed, His favor upon you has ever been great.
Say, "If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Qur’an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants."
And We have certainly diversified for the people in this Qur’an from every [kind] of example, but most of the people refused [anything] except disbelief.
And they say, "We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring.
Or [until] you have a garden of palm tress and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance]
Or you make the heaven fall upon us in fragments as you have claimed or you bring Allah and the angels before [us]
Or you have a house of gold or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read." Say, "Exalted is my Lord! Was I ever but a human messenger?"
And what prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said, "Has Allah sent a human messenger?"
Say, "If there were upon the earth angels walking securely, We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel [as a] messenger."
Say, "Sufficient is Allah as Witness between me and you. Indeed he is ever, concerning His servants, Acquainted and Seeing."
And whoever Allah guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray - you will never find for them protectors besides Him, and We will gather them on the Day of Resurrection [fallen] on their faces - blind, dumb and deaf. Their refuge is Hell; every time it subsides We increase them in blazing fire.
That is their recompense because they disbelieved in Our verses and said, "When we are bones and crumbled particles, will we [truly] be resurrected [in] a new creation?"
Do they not see that Allah, who created the heavens and earth, is [the one] Able to create the likes of them? And He has appointed for them a term, about which there is no doubt. But the wrongdoers refuse [anything] except disbelief.
Say [to them], "If you possessed the depositories of the mercy of my Lord, then you would withhold out of fear of spending." And ever has man been stingy.
And We had certainly given Moses nine evident signs, so ask the Children of Israel [about] when he came to them and Pharaoh said to him, "Indeed I think, O Moses, that you are affected by magic."
[Moses] said, "You have already known that none has sent down these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as evidence, and indeed I think, O Pharaoh, that you are destroyed."
So he intended to drive them from the land, but We drowned him and those with him all together.
And We said after Pharaoh to the Children of Israel, "Dwell in the land, and when there comes the promise of the Hereafter, We will bring you forth in [one] gathering."
And with the truth We have sent the Qur’an down, and with the truth it has descended. And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.
And [it is] a Qur’an which We have separated [by intervals] that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period. And We have sent it down progressively.
Say, "Believe in it or do not believe. Indeed, those who were given knowledge before it - when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration,
And they say, "Exalted is our Lord! Indeed, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled."
And they fall upon their faces weeping, and the Qur’an increases them in humble submission.
Say, "Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call - to Him belong the best names." And do not recite [too] loudly in your prayer or [too] quietly but seek between that an [intermediate] way.
And say, "Praise to Allah, who has not taken a son and has had no partner in [His] dominion and has no [need of a] protector out of weakness; and glorify Him with [great] glorification."
[All] praise is [due] to Allah, who has sent down upon His Servant the Book and has not made therein any deviance.
[He has made it] straight, to warn of severe punishment from Him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward
In which they will remain forever
And to warn those who say, "Allah has taken a son."
They have no knowledge of it, nor had their fathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie.
Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Muhammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow.
Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that We may test them [as to] which of them is best in deed.
And indeed, We will make that which is upon it [into] a barren ground.
Or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the inscription were, among Our signs, a wonder?
[Mention] when the youths retreated to the cave and said, "Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance."
So We cast [a cover of sleep] over their ears within the cave for a number of years.
Then We awakened them that We might show which of the two factions was most precise in calculating what [extent] they had remained in time.
It is We who relate to you, [O Muhammad], their story in truth. Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.
And We made firm their hearts when they stood up and said, "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never will we invoke besides Him any deity. We would have certainly spoken, then, an excessive transgression.
These, our people, have taken besides Him deities. Why do they not bring for [worship of] them a clear authority? And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah a lie?"
[The youths said to one another], "And when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than Allah, retreat to the cave. Your Lord will spread out for you of His mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility."
And [had you been present], you would see the sun when it rose, inclining away from their cave on the right, and when it set, passing away from them on the left, while they were [laying] within an open space thereof. That was from the signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides is the [rightly] guided, but he whom He leaves astray - never will you find for him a protecting guide.
And you would think them awake, while they were asleep. And We turned them to the right and to the left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. If you had looked at them, you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror.
And similarly, We awakened them that they might question one another. Said a speaker from among them, "How long have you remained [here]?" They said, "We have remained a day or part of a day." They said, "Your Lord is most knowing of how long you remained. So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be cautious. And let no one be aware of you.
Indeed, if they come to know of you, they will stone you or return you to their religion. And never would you succeed, then - ever."
And similarly, We caused them to be found that they [who found them] would know that the promise of Allah is truth and that of the Hour there is no doubt. [That was] when they disputed among themselves about their affair and [then] said, "Construct over them a structure. Their Lord is most knowing about them." Said those who prevailed in the matter, "We will surely take [for ourselves] over them a masjid."
They will say there were three, the fourth of them being their dog; and they will say there were five, the sixth of them being their dog - guessing at the unseen; and they will say there were seven, and the eighth of them was their dog. Say, [O Muhammad], "My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few. So do not argue about them except with an obvious argument and do not inquire about them among [the speculators] from anyone."
And never say of anything, "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,"
Except [when adding], "If Allah wills." And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct."
And they remained in their cave for three hundred years and exceeded by nine.
Say, "Allah is most knowing of how long they remained. He has [knowledge of] the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. How Seeing is He and how Hearing! They have not besides Him any protector, and He shares not His legislation with anyone."
And recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no changer of His words, and never will you find in other than Him a refuge.
And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His countenance. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect.
And say, "The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve." Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.
Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds.
Those will have gardens of perpetual residence; beneath them rivers will flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining therein on adorned couches. Excellent is the reward, and good is the resting place.
And present to them an example of two men: We granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines, and We bordered them with palm trees and placed between them [fields of] crops.
Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything. And We caused to gush forth within them a river.
And he had fruit, so he said to his companion while he was conversing with him, "I am greater than you in wealth and mightier in [numbers of] men."
And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said, "I do not think that this will perish - ever.
And I do not think the Hour will occur. And even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely find better than this as a return."
His companion said to him while he was conversing with him, "Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust and then from a sperm-drop and then proportioned you [as] a man?
But as for me, He is Allah, my Lord, and I do not associate with my Lord anyone.
And why did you, when you entered your garden, not say, 'What Allah willed [has occurred]; there is no power except in Allah’? Although you see me less than you in wealth and children,
It may be that my Lord will give me [something] better than your garden and will send upon it a calamity from the sky, and it will become a smooth, dusty ground,
Or its water will become sunken [into the earth], so you would never be able to seek it."
And his fruits were encompassed [by ruin], so he began to turn his hands about [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, while it had collapsed upon its trellises, and said, "Oh, I wish I had not associated with my Lord anyone."
And there was for him no company to aid him other than Allah, nor could he defend himself.
There the authority is [completely] for Allah, the Truth. He is best in reward and best in outcome.
And present to them the example of the life of this world, [its being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds. And Allah is ever, over all things, Perfect in Ability.
Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life. But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for [one's] hope.
And [warn of] the Day when We will remove the mountains and you will see the earth prominent, and We will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone.
And they will be presented before your Lord in rows, [and He will say], "You have certainly come to Us just as We created you the first time. But you claimed that We would never make for you an appointment."
And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, "Oh, woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing small or great except that it has enumerated it?" And they will find what they did present [before them]. And your Lord does injustice to no one.
And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange.
I did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth or to the creation of themselves, and I would not have taken the misguiders as assistants.
And [warn of] the Day when He will say, "Call 'My partners' whom you claimed," and they will invoke them, but they will not respond to them. And We will put between them [a valley of] destruction.
And the criminals will see the Fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein. And they will not find from it a way elsewhere.
And We have certainly diversified in this Qur’an for the people from every [kind of] example; but man has ever been, most of anything, [prone to] dispute.
And nothing has prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord except that there [must] befall them the [accustomed] precedent of the former peoples or that the punishment should come [directly] before them.
And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners. And those who disbelieve dispute by [using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalidate thereby the truth and have taken My verses, and that of which they are warned, in ridicule.
And who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth? Indeed, We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if you invite them to guidance - they will never be guided, then - ever.
And your Lord is the Forgiving, full of mercy. If He were to impose blame upon them for what they earned, He would have hastened for them the punishment. Rather, for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape.
And those cities - We destroyed them when they wronged, and We made for their destruction an appointed time.
And [mention] when Moses said to his servant, "I will not cease [traveling] until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period."
But when they reached the junction between them, they forgot their fish, and it took its course into the sea, slipping away.
So when they had passed beyond it, [Moses] said to his boy, "Bring us our morning meal. We have certainly suffered in this, our journey, [much] fatigue."
He said, "Did you see when we retired to the rock? Indeed, I forgot [there] the fish. And none made me forget it except Satan - that I should mention it. And it took its course into the sea amazingly".
[Moses] said, "That is what we were seeking." So they returned, following their footprints.
And they found a servant from among Our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from Us a [certain] knowledge.
Moses said to him, "May I follow you on [the condition] that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement?"
He said, "Indeed, with me you will never be able to have patience.
And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge?"
[Moses] said, "You will find me, if Allah wills, patient, and I will not disobey you in [any] order."
He said, "Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I make to you about it mention."
So they set out, until when they had embarked on the ship, al-Khidhr tore it open. [Moses] said, "Have you torn it open to drown its people? You have certainly done a grave thing."
[Al-Khidhr] said, "Did I not say that with me you would never be able to have patience?"
[Moses] said, "Do not blame me for what I forgot and do not cover me in my matter with difficulty."
So they set out, until when they met a boy, al-Khidhr killed him. [Moses] said, "Have you killed a pure soul for other than [having killed] a soul? You have certainly done a deplorable thing."
[Al-Khidhr] said, "Did I not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience?"
[Moses] said, "If I should ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me as a companion. You have obtained from me an excuse."
So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. And they found therein a wall about to collapse, so al-Khidhr restored it. [Moses] said, "If you wished, you could have taken for it a payment."
[Al-Khidhr] said, "This is parting between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience.
As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea. So I intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every [good] ship by force.
And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief.
So we intended that their Lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy.
And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure for them, and their father had been righteous. So your Lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. And I did it not of my own accord. That is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience."
And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about Dhul-Qarnayn. Say, "I will recite to you about him a report."
Indeed We established him upon the earth, and We gave him to everything a way.
So he followed a way
Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it [as if] setting in a spring of dark mud, and he found near it a people. Allah said, "O Dhul-Qarnayn, either you punish [them] or else adopt among them [a way of] goodness."
He said, "As for one who wrongs, we will punish him. Then he will be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with a terrible punishment.
But as for one who believes and does righteousness, he will have a reward of Paradise, and we will speak to him from our command with ease."
Then he followed a way
Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had not made against it any shield.
Thus. And We had encompassed [all] that he had in knowledge.
Then he followed a way
Until, when he reached [a pass] between two mountains, he found beside them a people who could hardly understand [his] speech.
They said, "O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog are [great] corrupters in the land. So may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make between us and them a barrier?"
He said, "That in which my Lord has established me is better [than what you offer], but assist me with strength; I will make between you and them a dam.
Bring me sheets of iron" - until, when he had leveled [them] between the two mountain walls, he said, "Blow [with bellows]," until when he had made it [like] fire, he said, "Bring me, that I may pour over it molten copper."
So Gog and Magog were unable to pass over it, nor were they able [to effect] in it any penetration.
[Dhul-Qarnayn] said, "This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it level, and ever is the promise of my Lord true."
And We will leave them that day surging over each other, and [then] the Horn will be blown, and We will assemble them in [one] assembly.
And We will present Hell that Day to the Disbelievers, on display -
Those whose eyes had been within a cover [removed] from My remembrance, and they were not able to hear.
Then do those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants instead of Me as allies? Indeed, We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers as a lodging.
Say, [O Muhammad], "Shall we [believers] inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds?
[They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work."
Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in [their] meeting Him, so their deeds have become worthless; and We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any importance.
That is their recompense - Hell - for what they denied and [because] they took My signs and My messengers in ridicule.
Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - they will have the Gardens of Paradise as a lodging,
Wherein they abide eternally. They will not desire from it any transfer.
Say, "If the sea were ink for [writing] the words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We brought the like of it as a supplement."
Say, "I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone."
Kaf, Ha, Ya, ‘Ayn, Sad.
[This is] a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zechariah
When he called to his Lord a private supplication.
He said, "My Lord, indeed my bones have weakened, and my head has filled with white, and never have I been in my supplication to You, my Lord, unhappy.
And indeed, I fear the successors after me, and my wife has been barren, so give me from Yourself an heir
Who will inherit me and inherit from the family of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, pleasing [to You]."
[He was told], "O Zechariah, indeed We give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be John. We have not assigned to any before [this] name."
He said, "My Lord, how will I have a boy when my wife has been barren and I have reached extreme old age?"
[An angel] said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, for I created you before, while you were nothing.' "
[Zechariah] said, "My Lord, make for me a sign." He said, "Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights, [being] sound."
So he came out to his people from the prayer chamber and signaled to them to exalt [Allah] in the morning and afternoon.
[Allah] said, "O John, take the Scripture with determination." And We gave him judgement [while yet] a boy
And affection from Us and purity, and he was fearing of Allah
And dutiful to his parents, and he was not a disobedient tyrant.
And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive.
And mention, [O Muhammad], in the Book [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.
And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.
She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah."
He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy."
She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"
He said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.' "
So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.
And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, "Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten."
But he called her from below her, "Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.
And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.
So eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, 'Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.' "
Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, "O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.
O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste."
So she pointed to him. They said, "How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?"
[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.
And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I remain alive
And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant.
And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive."
That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.
It is not [befitting] for Allah to take a son; exalted is He! When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.
[Jesus said], "And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path."
Then the factions differed [concerning Jesus] from among them, so woe to those who disbelieved - from the scene of a tremendous Day.
How [clearly] they will hear and see the Day they come to Us, but the wrongdoers today are in clear error.
And warn them, [O Muhammad], of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded; and [yet], they are in [a state of] heedlessness, and they do not believe.
Indeed, it is We who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it, and to Us they will be returned.
And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet.
[Mention] when he said to his father, "O my father, why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all?
O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to an even path.
O my father, do not worship Satan. Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient.
O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment from the Most Merciful so you would be to Satan a companion [in Hellfire]."
[His father] said, "Have you no desire for my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so avoid me a prolonged time."
[Abraham] said, "Peace will be upon you. I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me.
And I will leave you and those you invoke other than Allah and will invoke my Lord. I expect that I will not be in invocation to my Lord unhappy."
So when he had left them and those they worshipped other than Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each [of them] We made a prophet.
And We gave them of Our mercy, and we made for them a reputation of high honor.
And mention in the Book, Moses. Indeed, he was chosen, and he was a messenger and a prophet.
And We called him from the side of the mount at [his] right and brought him near, confiding [to him].
And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet.
And mention in the Book, Ishmael. Indeed, he was true to his promise, and he was a messenger and a prophet.
And he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zakah and was to his Lord pleasing.
And mention in the Book, Idrees. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet.
And We raised him to a high station.
Those were the ones upon whom Allah bestowed favor from among the prophets of the descendants of Adam and of those We carried [in the ship] with Noah, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they fell in prostration and weeping.
But there came after them successors who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going to meet evil -
Except those who repent, believe and do righteousness; for those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all.
[Therein are] gardens of perpetual residence which the Most Merciful has promised His servants in the unseen. Indeed, His promise has ever been coming.
They will not hear therein any ill speech - only [greetings of] peace - and they will have their provision therein, morning and afternoon.
That is Paradise, which We give as inheritance to those of Our servants who were fearing of Allah.
[Gabriel said], "And we [angels] descend not except by the order of your Lord. To Him belongs that before us and that behind us and what is in between. And never is your Lord forgetful -
Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them - so worship Him and have patience for His worship. Do you know of any similarity to Him?"
And the disbeliever says, "When I have died, am I going to be brought forth alive?"
Does man not remember that We created him before, while he was nothing?
So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will bring them to be present around Hell upon their knees.
Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the Most Merciful in insolence.
Then, surely it is We who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein.
And there is none of you except he will come to it. This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.
Then We will save those who feared Allah and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.
And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Which of [our] two parties is best in position and best in association?"
And how many a generation have We destroyed before them who were better in possessions and [outward] appearance?
Say, "Whoever is in error - let the Most Merciful extend for him an extension [in wealth and time] until, when they see that which they were promised - either punishment [in this world] or the Hour [of resurrection] - they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers."
And Allah increases those who were guided, in guidance, and the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for recourse.
Then, have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, "I will surely be given wealth and children [in the next life]?"
Has he looked into the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise?
No! We will record what he says and extend for him from the punishment extensively.
And We will inherit him [in] what he mentions, and he will come to Us alone.
And they have taken besides Allah [false] deities that they would be for them [a source of] honor.
No! Those "gods" will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents [on the Day of Judgement].
Do you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them to [evil] with [constant] incitement?
So be not impatient over them. We only count out to them a [limited] number.
On the Day We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful as a delegation
And will drive the criminals to Hell in thirst
None will have [power of] intercession except he who had taken from the Most Merciful a covenant.
And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son."
You have done an atrocious thing.
The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation
That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.
And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.
There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant.
He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting.
And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.
Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - the Most Merciful will appoint for them affection.
So, [O Muhammad], We have only made Qur’an easy in the Arabic language that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous and warn thereby a hostile people.
And how many have We destroyed before them of generations? Do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound?
Ta, Ha.
We have not sent down to you the Qur’an that you be distressed
But only as a reminder for those who fear [Allah] -
A revelation from He who created the earth and highest heavens,
The Most Merciful [who is] above the Throne established.
To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and what is between them and what is under the soil.
And if you speak aloud - then indeed, He knows the secret and what is [even] more hidden.
Allah - there is no deity except Him. To Him belong the best names.
And has the story of Moses reached you? -
When he saw a fire and said to his family, "Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire; perhaps I can bring you a torch or find at the fire some guidance."
And when he came to it, he was called, "O Moses,
Indeed, I am your Lord, so remove your sandals. Indeed, you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.
And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed [to you].
Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.
Indeed, the Hour is coming - I almost conceal it - so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives.
So do not let one avert you from it who does not believe in it and follows his desire, for you [then] would perish.
And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?"
He said, "It is my staff; I lean upon it, and I bring down leaves for my sheep and I have therein other uses."
[Allah] said, "Throw it down, O Moses."
So he threw it down, and thereupon it was a snake, moving swiftly.
[Allah] said, "Seize it and fear not; We will return it to its former condition.
And draw in your hand to your side; it will come out white without disease - another sign,
That We may show you [some] of Our greater signs.
Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed."
[Moses] said, "My Lord, expand for me my breast [with assurance]
And ease for me my task
And untie the knot from my tongue
That they may understand my speech.
And appoint for me a minister from my family -
Aaron, my brother.
Increase through him my strength
And let him share my task
That we may exalt You much
And remember You much.
Indeed, You are of us ever Seeing."
[Allah] said, "You have been granted your request, O Moses.
And We had already conferred favor upon you another time,
When We inspired to your mother what We inspired,
[Saying], ‘Cast him into the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; there will take him an enemy to Me and an enemy to him.’ And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you would be brought up under My eye.
[And We favored you] when your sister went and said, ‘Shall I direct you to someone who will be responsible for him?’ So We restored you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve. And you killed someone, but We saved you from retaliation and tried you with a [severe] trial. And you remained [some] years among the people of Madyan. Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses.
And I produced you for Myself.
Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not slacken in My remembrance.
Go, both of you, to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.
And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear [Allah]."
They said, "Our Lord, indeed we are afraid that he will hasten [punishment] against us or that he will transgress."
[Allah] said, "Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see.
So go to him and say, ‘Indeed, we are messengers of your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And peace will be upon he who follows the guidance.
Indeed, it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies and turns away.’ "
[Pharaoh] said, "So who is the Lord of you two, O Moses?"
He said, "Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and then guided [it]."
[Pharaoh] said, "Then what is the case of the former generations?"
[Moses] said, "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets."
[It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed [spread out] and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky, rain and produced thereby categories of various plants.
Eat [therefrom] and pasture your livestock. Indeed, in that are signs for those of intelligence.
From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time.
And We certainly showed Pharaoh Our signs - all of them - but he denied and refused.
He said, "Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?
Then we will surely bring you magic like it, so make between us and you an appointment, which we will not fail to keep and neither will you, in a place assigned."
[Moses] said, "Your appointment is on the day of the festival when the people assemble at mid-morning."
So Pharaoh went away, put together his plan, and then came [to Moses].
Moses said to the magicians summoned by Pharaoh, "Woe to you! Do not invent a lie against Allah or He will exterminate you with a punishment; and he has failed who invents [such falsehood]."
So they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation.
They said, "Indeed, these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way.
So resolve upon your plan and then come [forward] in line. And he has succeeded today who overcomes."
They said, "O Moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw."
He said, "Rather, you throw." And suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving [like snakes].
And he sensed within himself apprehension, did Moses.
Allah said, "Fear not. Indeed, it is you who are superior.
And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted. What they have crafted is but the trick of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he is."
So the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, "We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."
[Pharaoh] said, "You believed him before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will surely know which of us is more severe in [giving] punishment and more enduring."
They said, "Never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and [over] He who created us. So decree whatever you are to decree. You can only decree for this worldly life.
Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic. And Allah is better and more enduring."
Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal - indeed, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live.
But whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous deeds - for those will be the highest degrees [in position]:
Gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of one who purifies himself.
And We had inspired to Moses, "Travel by night with My servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea; you will not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] nor be afraid [of drowning]."
So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and there covered them from the sea that which covered them,
And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them].
O Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made an appointment with you at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quails,
[Saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have provided you and do not transgress [or oppress others] therein, lest My anger should descend upon you. And he upon whom My anger descends has certainly fallen."
But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.
[Allah] said, "And what made you hasten from your people, O Moses?"
He said, "They are close upon my tracks, and I hastened to You, my Lord, that You be pleased."
[Allah] said, "But indeed, We have tried your people after you [departed], and the Samiri has led them astray."
So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved. He said, "O my people, did your Lord not make you a good promise? Then, was the time [of its fulfillment] too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord descend upon you, so you broke your promise [of obedience] to me?"
They said, "We did not break our promise to you by our will, but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people [of Pharaoh], so we threw them [into the fire], and thus did the Samiri throw."
And he extracted for them [the statue of] a calf which had a lowing sound, and they said, "This is your god and the god of Moses, but he forgot."
Did they not see that it could not return to them any speech and that it did not possess for them any harm or benefit?
And Aaron had already told them before [the return of Moses], "O my people, you are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my order."
They said, "We will never cease being devoted to the calf until Moses returns to us."
[Moses] said, "O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray,
From following me? Then have you disobeyed my order?"
[Aaron] said, "O son of my mother, do not seize [me] by my beard or by my head. Indeed, I feared that you would say, ‘You caused division among the Children of Israel, and you did not observe [or await] my word.’ "
[Moses] said, "And what is your case, O Samiri?"
He said, "I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the track of the messenger and threw it, and thus did my soul entice me."
[Moses] said, "Then go. And indeed, it is [decreed] for you in [this] life to say, ‘No contact.’ And indeed, you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep. And look at your ‘god’ to which you remained devoted. We will surely burn it and blow it into the sea with a blast.
Your god is only Allah, except for whom there is no deity. He has encompassed all things in knowledge."
Thus, [O Muhammad], We relate to you from the news of what has preceded. And We have certainly given you from Us the Qur’an.
Whoever turns away from it - then indeed, he will bear on the Day of Resurrection a burden,
[Abiding] eternally therein, and evil it is for them on the Day of Resurrection as a load -
The Day the Horn will be blown. And We will gather the criminals, that Day, blue-eyed.
They will murmur among themselves, "You remained not but ten [days in the world]."
We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in manner will say, "You remained not but one day."
And they ask you about the mountains, so say, "My Lord will blow them away with a blast.
And He will leave the earth a level plain;
You will not see therein a depression or an elevation."
That Day, everyone will follow [the call of] the Caller [with] no deviation therefrom, and [all] voices will be stilled before the Most Merciful, so you will not hear except a whisper [of footsteps].
That Day, no intercession will benefit except [that of] one to whom the Most Merciful has given permission and has accepted his word.
Allah knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, but they do not encompass it in knowledge.
And [all] faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. And he will have failed who carries injustice.
But he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer - he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation.
And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid [sin] or it would cause them remembrance.
So high [above all] is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth. And, [O Muhammad], do not hasten with [recitation of] the Qur’an before its revelation is completed to you, and say, "My Lord, increase me in knowledge."
And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.
And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam," and they prostrated, except Iblees; he refused.
So We said, "O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer.
Indeed, it is [promised] for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed.
And indeed, you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun."
Then Satan whispered to him; he said, "O Adam, shall I direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?"
And Adam and his wife ate of it, and their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and erred.
Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided [him].
[Allah] said, "Descend from Paradise - all, [your descendants] being enemies to one another. And if there should come to you guidance from Me - then whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray [in the world] nor suffer [in the Hereafter].
And whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind."
He will say, "My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I was [once] seeing?"
[Allah] will say, "Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot them; and thus will you this Day be forgotten."
And thus do We recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring.
Then, has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence.
And if not for a word that preceded from your Lord, punishment would have been an obligation [due immediately], and [if not for] a specified term [decreed].
So be patient over what they say and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and during periods of the night [exalt Him] and at the ends of the day, that you may be satisfied.
And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them. And the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring.
And enjoin prayer upon your family [and people] and be steadfast therein. We ask you not for provision; We provide for you, and the [best] outcome is for [those of] righteousness.
And they say, "Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?" Has there not come to them evidence of what was in the former scriptures?
And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, "Our Lord, why did You not send to us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced?"
Say, "Each [of us] is waiting; so wait. For you will know who are the companions of the sound path and who is guided."
[The time of] their account has approached for the people, while they are in heedlessness turning away.
No mention comes to them anew from their Lord except that they listen to it while they are at play
With their hearts distracted. And those who do wrong conceal their private conversation, [saying], "Is this [Prophet] except a human being like you? So would you approach magic while you are aware [of it]?"
The Prophet said, "My Lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing."
But they say, "[The revelation is but] a mixture of false dreams; rather, he has invented it; rather, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign just as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles]."
Not a [single] city which We destroyed believed before them, so will they believe?
And We sent not before you, [O Muhammad], except men to whom We revealed [the message], so ask the people of the message if you do not know.
And We did not make the prophets forms not eating food, nor were they immortal [on earth].
Then We fulfilled for them the promise, and We saved them and whom We willed and destroyed the transgressors.
We have certainly sent down to you a Book in which is your mention. Then will you not reason?
And how many a city which was unjust have We shattered and produced after it another people.
And when its inhabitants perceived Our punishment, at once they fled from it.
[Some angels said], "Do not flee but return to where you were given luxury and to your homes - perhaps you will be questioned."
They said, "O woe to us! Indeed, we were wrongdoers."
And that declaration of theirs did not cease until We made them [as] a harvest [mowed down], extinguished [like a fire].
And We did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.
Had We intended to take a diversion, We could have taken it from [what is] with Us - if [indeed] We were to do so.
Rather, We dash the truth upon falsehood, and it destroys it, and thereupon it departs. And for you is destruction from that which you describe.
To Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those near Him are not prevented by arrogance from His worship, nor do they tire.
They exalt [Him] night and day [and] do not slacken.
Or have men taken for themselves gods from the earth who resurrect [the dead]?
Had there been within the heavens and earth gods besides Allah, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is Allah, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe.
He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.
Or have they taken gods besides Him? Say, [O Muhammad], "Produce your proof. This [Qur’an] is the message for those with me and the message of those before me." But most of them do not know the truth, so they are turning away.
And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, "There is no deity except Me, so worship Me."
And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken a son." Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.
They cannot precede Him in word, and they act by His command.
He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they, from fear of Him, are apprehensive.
And whoever of them should say, "Indeed, I am a god besides Him"- that one We would recompense with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.
Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?
And We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] passes [as] roads that they might be guided.
And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away.
And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming.
And We did not grant to any man before you eternity [on earth]; so if you die - would they be eternal?
Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.
And when those who disbelieve see you, [O Muhammad], they take you not except in ridicule, [saying], "Is this the one who insults your gods?" And they are, at the mention of the Most Merciful, disbelievers.
Man was created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not impatiently urge Me.
And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"
If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not avert the Fire from their faces or from their backs and they will not be aided...
Rather, it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them, and they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be reprieved.
And already were messengers ridiculed before you, but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
Say, "Who can protect you at night or by day from the Most Merciful?" But they are, from the remembrance of their Lord, turning away.
Or do they have gods to defend them other than Us? They are unable [even] to help themselves, nor can they be protected from Us.
But, [on the contrary], We have provided good things for these [disbelievers] and their fathers until life was prolonged for them. Then do they not see that We set upon the land, reducing it from its borders? So it is they who will overcome?
Say, "I only warn you by revelation." But the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned.
And if [as much as] a whiff of the punishment of your Lord should touch them, they would surely say, "O woe to us! Indeed, we have been wrongdoers."
And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly at all. And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountant.
And We had already given Moses and Aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder for the righteous
Who fear their Lord unseen, while they are of the Hour apprehensive.
And this [Qur’an] is a blessed message which We have sent down. Then are you with it unacquainted?
And We had certainly given Abraham his sound judgement before, and We were of him well-Knowing
When he said to his father and his people, "What are these statues to which you are devoted?"
They said, "We found our fathers worshippers of them."
He said, "You were certainly, you and your fathers, in manifest error."
They said, "Have you come to us with truth, or are you of those who jest?"
He said, "[No], rather, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth who created them, and I, to that, am of those who testify.
And [I swear] by Allah, I will surely plan against your idols after you have turned and gone away."
So he made them into fragments, except a large one among them, that they might return to it [and question].
They said, "Who has done this to our gods? Indeed, he is of the wrongdoers."
They said, "We heard a young man mention them who is called Abraham."
They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify."
They said, "Have you done this to our gods, O Abraham?"
He said, "Rather, this - the largest of them - did it, so ask them, if they should [be able to] speak."
So they returned to [blaming] themselves and said [to each other], "Indeed, you are the wrongdoers."
Then they reversed themselves, [saying], "You have already known that these do not speak!"
He said, "Then do you worship instead of Allah that which does not benefit you at all or harm you?
Uff to you and to what you worship instead of Allah. Then will you not use reason?"
They said, "Burn him and support your gods - if you are to act."
Allah said, "O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham."
And they intended for him harm, but We made them the greatest losers.
And We delivered him and Lot to the land which We had blessed for the worlds.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob in addition, and all [of them] We made righteous.
And We made them leaders guiding by Our command. And We inspired to them the doing of good deeds, establishment of prayer, and giving of zakah; and they were worshippers of Us.
And to Lot We gave judgement and knowledge, and We saved him from the city that was committing wicked deeds. Indeed, they were a people of evil, defiantly disobedient.
And We admitted him into Our mercy. Indeed, he was of the righteous.
And [mention] Noah, when he called [to Allah] before [that time], so We responded to him and saved him and his family from the great flood.
And We saved him from the people who denied Our signs. Indeed, they were a people of evil, so We drowned them, all together.
And [mention] David and Solomon, when they judged concerning the field -when the sheep of a people overran it [at night], and We were witness to their judgement.
And We gave understanding of the case to Solomon, and to each [of them] We gave judgement and knowledge. And We subjected the mountains to exalt [Us], along with David and [also] the birds. And We were doing [that].
And We taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect you from your [enemy in] battle. So will you then be grateful?
And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind, blowing forcefully, proceeding by his command toward the land which We had blessed. And We are ever, of all things, Knowing.
And of the devils were those who dived for him and did work other than that. And We were of them a guardian.
And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, "Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful."
So We responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity. And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers [of Allah].
And [mention] Ishmael and Idrees and Dhul-Kifl; all were of the patient.
And We admitted them into Our mercy. Indeed, they were of the righteous.
And [mention] the man of the fish, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not decree [anything] upon him. And he called out within the darknesses, "There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers."
So We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus do We save the believers.
And [mention] Zechariah, when he called to his Lord, "My Lord, do not leave me alone [with no heir], while you are the best of inheritors."
So We responded to him, and We gave to him John, and amended for him his wife. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us humbly submissive.
And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity, so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [Gabriel], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds.
Indeed this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.
And [yet] they divided their affair among themselves, [but] all to Us will return.
So whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer - no denial will there be for his effort, and indeed We, of it, are recorders.
And there is prohibition upon [the people of] a city which We have destroyed that they will [ever] return
Until when [the dam of] Gog and Magog has been opened and they, from every elevation, descend
And [when] the true promise has approached; then suddenly the eyes of those who disbelieved will be staring [in horror, while they say], "O woe to us; we had been unmindful of this; rather, we were wrongdoers."
Indeed, you [disbelievers] and what you worship other than Allah are the firewood of Hell. You will be coming to [enter] it.
Had these [false deities] been [actual] gods, they would not have come to it, but all are eternal therein.
For them therein is heavy sighing, and they therein will not hear.
Indeed, those for whom the best [reward] has preceded from Us - they are from it far removed.
They will not hear its sound, while they are, in that which their souls desire, abiding eternally.
They will not be grieved by the greatest terror, and the angels will meet them, [saying], "This is your Day which you have been promised" -
The Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a [written] sheet for the records. As We began the first creation, We will repeat it. [That is] a promise binding upon Us. Indeed, We will do it.
And We have already written in the book [of Psalms] after the [previous] mention that the land [of Paradise] is inherited by My righteous servants.
Indeed, in this [Qur’an] is notification for a worshipping people.
And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.
Say, "It is only revealed to me that your god is but one God; so will you be Muslims [in submission to Him]?"
But if they turn away, then say, "I have announced to [all of] you equally. And I know not whether near or far is that which you are promised.
Indeed, He knows what is declared of speech, and He knows what you conceal.
And I know not; perhaps it is a trial for you and enjoyment for a time."
[The Prophet] has said, "My Lord, judge [between us] in truth. And our Lord is the Most Merciful, the one whose help is sought against that which you describe."
O mankind, fear your Lord. Indeed, the convulsion of the [final] Hour is a terrible thing.
On the Day you see it every nursing mother will be distracted from that [child] she was nursing, and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the people [appearing] intoxicated while they are not intoxicated; but the punishment of Allah is severe.
And of the people is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil.
It has been decreed for every devil that whoever turns to him - he will misguide him and will lead him to the punishment of the Blaze.
O People, if you should be in doubt about the Resurrection, then [consider that] indeed, We created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot, and then from a lump of flesh, formed and unformed - that We may show you. And We settle in the wombs whom We will for a specified term, then We bring you out as a child, and then [We develop you] that you may reach your [time of] maturity. And among you is he who is taken in [early] death, and among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit [old] age so that he knows, after [once having] knowledge, nothing. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and swells and grows [something] of every beautiful kind.
That is because Allah is the Truth and because He gives life to the dead and because He is over all things competent
And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming - no doubt about it - and that Allah will resurrect those in the graves.
And of the people is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book [from Him],
Twisting his neck [in arrogance] to mislead [people] from the way of Allah. For him in the world is disgrace, and We will make him taste on the Day of Resurrection the punishment of the Burning Fire [while it is said],
"That is for what your hands have put forth and because Allah is not ever unjust to [His] servants."
And of the people is he who worships Allah on an edge. If he is touched by good, he is reassured by it; but if he is struck by trial, he turns on his face [to the other direction]. He has lost [this] world and the Hereafter. That is what is the manifest loss.
He invokes instead of Allah that which neither harms him nor benefits him. That is what is the extreme error.
He invokes one whose harm is closer than his benefit - how wretched the protector and how wretched the associate.
Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. Indeed, Allah does what He intends.
Whoever should think that Allah will not support [Prophet Muhammad] in this world and the Hereafter - let him extend a rope to the ceiling, then cut off [his breath], and let him see: will his effort remove that which enrages [him]?
And thus have We sent the Qur’an down as verses of clear evidence and because Allah guides whom He intends.
Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who associated with Allah - Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed Allah is, over all things, Witness.
Do you not see that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures and many of the people? But upon many the punishment has been justified. And he whom Allah humiliates - for him there is no bestower of honor. Indeed, Allah does what He wills.
These are two adversaries who have disputed over their Lord. But those who disbelieved will have cut out for them garments of fire. Poured upon their heads will be scalding water
By which is melted that within their bellies and [their] skins.
And for [striking] them are maces of iron.
Every time they want to get out of Hellfire from anguish, they will be returned to it, and [it will be said], "Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire!"
Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl, and their garments therein will be silk.
And they had been guided [in worldly life] to good speech, and they were guided to the path of the Praiseworthy.
Indeed, those who have disbelieved and avert [people] from the way of Allah and [from] al-Masjid al-Haram, which We made for the people - equal are the resident therein and one from outside; and [also] whoever intends [a deed] therein of deviation [in religion] or wrongdoing - We will make him taste of a painful punishment.
And [mention, O Muhammad], when We designated for Abraham the site of the House, [saying], "Do not associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who stand [in prayer] and those who bow and prostrate.
And proclaim to the people the hajj [pilgrimage]; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every distant pass -
That they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah on known days over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals. So eat of them and feed the miserable and poor.
Then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform Tawaf around the ancient House."
That [has been commanded], and whoever honors the sacred ordinances of Allah - it is best for him in the sight of his Lord. And permitted to you are the grazing livestock, except what is recited to you. So avoid the uncleanliness of idols and avoid false statement,
Inclining [only] to Allah, not associating [anything] with Him. And he who associates with Allah - it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place.
That [is so]. And whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts.
For you the animals marked for sacrifice are benefits for a specified term; then their place of sacrifice is at the ancient House.
And for all religion We have appointed a rite [of sacrifice] that they may mention the name of Allah over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals. For your god is one God, so to Him submit. And, [O Muhammad], give good tidings to the humble [before their Lord]
Who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts are fearful, and [to] the patient over what has afflicted them, and the establishers of prayer and those who spend from what We have provided them.
And the camels and cattle We have appointed for you as among the symbols of Allah; for you therein is good. So mention the name of Allah upon them when lined up [for sacrifice]; and when they are [lifeless] on their sides, then eat from them and feed the needy and the beggar. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may be grateful.
Their meat will not reach Allah, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and give good tidings to the doers of good.
Indeed, Allah defends those who have believed. Indeed, Allah does not like everyone treacherous and ungrateful.
Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory.
[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, "Our Lord is Allah." And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.
[And they are] those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. And to Allah belongs the outcome of [all] matters.
And if they deny you, [O Muhammad] - so, before them, did the people of Noah and ‘Aad and Thamud deny [their prophets],
And the people of Abraham and the people of Lot
And the inhabitants of Madyan. And Moses was denied, so I prolonged enjoyment for the disbelievers; then I seized them, and how [terrible] was My reproach.
And how many a city did We destroy while it was committing wrong - so it is [now] fallen into ruin - and [how many] an abandoned well and [how many] a lofty palace.
So have they not traveled through the earth and have hearts by which to reason and ears by which to hear? For indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts.
And they urge you to hasten the punishment. But Allah will never fail in His promise. And indeed, a day with your Lord is like a thousand years of those which you count.
And for how many a city did I prolong enjoyment while it was committing wrong. Then I seized it, and to Me is the [final] destination.
Say, "O people, I am only to you a clear warner."
And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and noble provision.
But the ones who strove against Our verses, [seeking] to cause failure - those are the companions of Hellfire.
And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in; then Allah makes precise His verses. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.
[That is] so He may make what Satan throws in a trial for those within whose hearts is disease and those hard of heart. And indeed, the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension.
And so those who were given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord and [therefore] believe in it, and their hearts humbly submit to it. And indeed is Allah the Guide of those who have believed to a straight path.
But those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it until the Hour comes upon them unexpectedly or there comes to them the punishment of a barren Day.
[All] sovereignty that Day is for Allah; He will judge between them. So they who believed and did righteous deeds will be in the Gardens of Pleasure.
And they who disbelieved and denied Our signs - for those there will be a humiliating punishment.
And those who emigrated for the cause of Allah and then were killed or died - Allah will surely provide for them a good provision. And indeed, it is Allah who is the best of providers.
He will surely cause them to enter an entrance with which they will be pleased, and indeed, Allah is Knowing and Forbearing.
That [is so]. And whoever responds [to injustice] with the equivalent of that with which he was harmed and then is tyrannized - Allah will surely aid him. Indeed, Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.
That is because Allah causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.
That is because Allah is the Truth, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the Most High, the Grand.
Do you not see that Allah has sent down rain from the sky and the earth becomes green? Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Acquainted.
To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. And indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.
Do you not see that Allah has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships which run through the sea by His command? And He restrains the sky from falling upon the earth, unless by His permission. Indeed Allah, to the people, is Kind and Merciful.
And He is the one who gave you life; then He causes you to die and then will [again] give you life. Indeed, mankind is ungrateful.
For every religion We have appointed rites which they perform. So, [O Muhammad], let the disbelievers not contend with you over the matter but invite them to your Lord. Indeed, you are upon straight guidance.
And if they dispute with you, then say, "Allah is most knowing of what you do.
Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ."
Do you not know that Allah knows what is in the heaven and earth? Indeed, that is in a Record. Indeed that, for Allah, is easy.
And they worship besides Allah that for which He has not sent down authority and that of which they have no knowledge. And there will not be for the wrongdoers any helper.
And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval. They are almost on the verge of assaulting those who recite to them Our verses. Say, "Then shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that? [It is] the Fire which Allah has promised those who disbelieve, and wretched is the destination."
O people, an example is presented, so listen to it. Indeed, those you invoke besides Allah will never create [as much as] a fly, even if they gathered together for that purpose. And if the fly should steal away from them a [tiny] thing, they could not recover it from him. Weak are the pursuer and pursued.
They have not appraised Allah with true appraisal. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.
Allah chooses from the angels messengers and from the people. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing.
He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them. And to Allah will be returned [all] matters.
O you who have believed, bow and prostrate and worship your Lord and do good - that you may succeed.
And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. Allah named you "Muslims" before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give zakah and hold fast to Allah. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.
Certainly will the believers have succeeded:
They who are during their prayer humbly submissive
And they who turn away from ill speech
And they who are observant of zakah
And they who guard their private parts
Except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed -
But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors -
And they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive
And they who carefully maintain their prayers -
Those are the inheritors
Who will inherit al-Firdaus. They will abide therein eternally.
And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay.
Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging.
Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators.
Then indeed, after that you are to die.
Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, will be resurrected.
And We have created above you seven layered heavens, and never have We been of [Our] creation unaware.
And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth. And indeed, We are Able to take it away.
And We brought forth for you thereby gardens of palm trees and grapevines in which for you are abundant fruits and from which you eat.
And [We brought forth] a tree issuing from Mount Sinai which produces oil and food for those who eat.
And indeed, for you in livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from that which is in their bellies, and for you in them are numerous benefits, and from them you eat.
And upon them and on ships you are carried.
And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, "O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him; then will you not fear Him?"
But the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, "This is not but a man like yourselves who wishes to take precedence over you; and if Allah had willed [to send a messenger], He would have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among our forefathers.
He is not but a man possessed with madness, so wait concerning him for a time."
[Noah] said, "My Lord, support me because they have denied me."
So We inspired to him, "Construct the ship under Our observation, and Our inspiration, and when Our command comes and the oven overflows, put into the ship from each [creature] two mates and your family, except those for whom the decree [of destruction] has proceeded. And do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are to be drowned.
And when you have boarded the ship, you and those with you, then say, ‘Praise to Allah who has saved us form the wrongdoing people.’
And say, ‘My Lord, let me land at a blessed landing place, and You are the best to accommodate [us].’ "
Indeed in that are signs, and indeed, We are ever testing [Our servants].
Then We produced after them a generation of others.
And We sent among them a messenger from themselves, [saying], "Worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him; then will you not fear Him?"
And the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter while We had given them luxury in the worldly life said, "This is not but a man like yourselves. He eats of that from which you eat and drinks of what you drink.
And if you should obey a man like yourselves, indeed, you would then be losers.
Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones that you will be brought forth [once more]?
How far, how far, is that which you are promised.
Life is not but our worldly life - we die and live, but we will not be resurrected.
He is not but a man who has invented a lie about Allah, and we will not believe him."
He said, "My Lord, support me because they have denied me."
[Allah] said, "After a little, they will surely become regretful."
So the shriek seized them in truth, and We made them as [plant] stubble. Then away with the wrongdoing people.
Then We produced after them other generations.
No nation will precede its time [of termination], nor will they remain [thereafter].
Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation its messenger, they denied him, so We made them follow one another [to destruction], and We made them narrations. So away with a people who do not believe.
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority
To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they were arrogant and were a haughty people.
They said, "Should we believe two men like ourselves while their people are for us in servitude?"
So they denied them and were of those destroyed.
And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture that perhaps they would be guided.
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign and sheltered them within a high ground having level [areas] and flowing water.
[Allah said], "O messengers, eat from the good foods and work righteousness. Indeed, I, of what you do, am Knowing.
And indeed this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so fear Me."
But the people divided their religion among them into sects - each faction, in what it has, rejoicing.
So leave them in their confusion for a time.
Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children
Is [because] We hasten for them good things? Rather, they do not perceive.
Indeed, they who are apprehensive from fear of their Lord
And they who believe in the signs of their Lord
And they who do not associate anything with their Lord
And they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their Lord -
It is those who hasten to good deeds, and they outstrip [others] therein.
And We charge no soul except [with that within] its capacity, and with Us is a record which speaks with truth; and they will not be wronged.
But their hearts are covered with confusion over this, and they have [evil] deeds besides disbelief which they are doing,
Until when We seize their affluent ones with punishment, at once they are crying [to Allah] for help.
Do not cry out today. Indeed, by Us you will not be helped.
My verses had already been recited to you, but you were turning back on your heels
In arrogance regarding it, conversing by night, speaking evil.
Then have they not reflected over the Qur’an, or has there come to them that which had not come to their forefathers?
Or did they not know their Messenger, so they are toward him disacknowledging?
Or do they say, "In him is madness?" Rather, he brought them the truth, but most of them, to the truth, are averse.
But if the Truth had followed their inclinations, the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined. Rather, We have brought them their message, but they, from their message, are turning away.
Or do you, [O Muhammad], ask them for payment? But the reward of your Lord is best, and He is the best of providers.
And indeed, you invite them to a straight path.
But indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from the path.
And even if We gave them mercy and removed what was upon them of affliction, they would persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.
And We had gripped them with suffering [as a warning], but they did not yield to their Lord, nor did they humbly supplicate, [and will continue thus]
Until when We have opened before them a door of severe punishment, immediately they will be therein in despair.
And it is He who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts; little are you grateful.
And it is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.
And it is He who gives life and causes death, and His is the alternation of the night and the day. Then will you not reason?
Rather, they say like what the former peoples said.
They said, "When we have died and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected?
We have been promised this, we and our forefathers, before; this is not but legends of the former peoples."
Say, [O Muhammad], "To whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it, if you should know?"
They will say, "To Allah." Say, "Then will you not remember?"
Say, "Who is Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Great Throne?"
They will say, "[They belong] to Allah." Say, "Then will you not fear Him?"
Say, "In whose hand is the realm of all things - and He protects while none can protect against Him - if you should know?"
They will say, "[All belongs] to Allah." Say, "Then how are you deluded?"
Rather, We have brought them the truth, and indeed they are liars.
Allah has not taken any son, nor has there ever been with Him any deity. [If there had been], then each deity would have taken what it created, and some of them would have sought to overcome others. Exalted is Allah above what they describe [concerning Him].
[He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, so high is He above what they associate [with Him].
Say, [O Muhammad], "My Lord, if You should show me that which they are promised,
My Lord, then do not place me among the wrongdoing people."
And indeed, We are able to show you what We have promised them.
Repel, by [means of] what is best, [their] evil. We are most knowing of what they describe.
And say, "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils,
And I seek refuge in You, my Lord , lest they be present with me."
[For such is the state of the disbelievers], until, when death comes to one of them, he says, "My Lord, send me back
That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind." No! It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected.
So when the Horn is blown, no relationship will there be among them that Day, nor will they ask about one another.
And those whose scales are heavy [with good deeds] - it is they who are the successful.
But those whose scales are light - those are the ones who have lost their souls, [being] in Hell, abiding eternally.
The Fire will sear their faces, and they therein will have taut smiles.
[It will be said]. "Were not My verses recited to you and you used to deny them?"
They will say, "Our Lord, our wretchedness overcame us, and we were a people astray.
Our Lord, remove us from it, and if we were to return [to evil], we would indeed be wrongdoers."
He will say, "Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me.
Indeed, there was a party of My servants who said, ‘Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and You are the best of the merciful.’
But you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them.
Indeed, I have rewarded them this Day for their patient endurance - that they are the attainers [of success]."
[Allah] will say, "How long did you remain on earth in number of years?"
They will say, "We remained a day or part of a day; ask those who enumerate."
He will say, "You stayed not but a little - if only you had known.
Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"
So exalted is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth; there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne.
And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof - then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.
And, [O Muhammad], say, "My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the best of the merciful."
[This is] a surah which We have sent down and made [that within it] obligatory and revealed therein verses of clear evidence that you might remember.
The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual intercourse - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes, and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion of Allah, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.
The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator or a polytheist, and that has been made unlawful to the believers.
And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses - lash them with eighty lashes and do not accept from them testimony ever after. And those are the defiantly disobedient,
Except for those who repent thereafter and reform, for indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And those who accuse their wives [of adultery] and have no witnesses except themselves - then the witness of one of them [shall be] four testimonies [swearing] by Allah that indeed, he is of the truthful.
And the fifth [oath will be] that the curse of Allah be upon him if he should be among the liars.
But it will prevent punishment from her if she gives four testimonies [swearing] by Allah that indeed, he is of the liars.
And the fifth [oath will be] that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he was of the truthful.
And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy...and because Allah is Accepting of repentance and Wise.
Indeed, those who came with falsehood are a group among you. Do not think it bad for you; rather it is good for you. For every person among them is what [punishment] he has earned from the sin, and he who took upon himself the greater portion thereof - for him is a great punishment.
Why, when you heard it, did not the believing men and believing women think good of one another and say, "This is an obvious falsehood"?
Why did they [who slandered] not produce for it four witnesses? And when they do not produce the witnesses, then it is they, in the sight of Allah, who are the liars.
And if it had not been for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, you would have been touched for that [lie] in which you were involved by a great punishment
When you received it with your tongues and said with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge and thought it was insignificant while it was, in the sight of Allah, tremendous.
And why, when you heard it, did you not say, "It is not for us to speak of this. Exalted are You, [O Allah]; this is a great slander"?
Allah warns you against returning to the likes of this [conduct], ever, if you should be believers.
And Allah makes clear to you the verses, and Allah is Knowing and Wise.
Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread [or publicized] among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah knows and you do not know.
And if it had not been for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy...and because Allah is Kind and Merciful.
O you who have believed, do not follow the footsteps of Satan. And whoever follows the footsteps of Satan - indeed, he enjoins immorality and wrongdoing. And if not for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have been pure, ever, but Allah purifies whom He wills, and Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
And let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give [aid] to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants for the cause of Allah, and let them pardon and overlook. Would you not like that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Indeed, those who [falsely] accuse chaste, unaware and believing women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and they will have a great punishment
On a Day when their tongues, their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do.
That Day, Allah will pay them in full their deserved recompense, and they will know that it is Allah who is the perfect in justice.
Evil words are for evil men, and evil men are [subjected] to evil words. And good words are for good men, and good men are [an object] of good words. Those [good people] are declared innocent of what the slanderers say. For them is forgiveness and noble provision.
O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet their inhabitants. That is best for you; perhaps you will be reminded.
And if you do not find anyone therein, do not enter them until permission has been given you. And if it is said to you, "Go back," then go back; it is purer for you. And Allah is Knowing of what you do.
There is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited in which there is convenience for you. And Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal.
Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do.
And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands’ fathers, their sons, their husbands’ sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.
And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. If they should be poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty, and Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing.
But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.
And We have certainly sent down to you distinct verses and examples from those who passed on before you and an admonition for those who fear Allah.
Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He wills. And Allah presents examples for the people, and Allah is Knowing of all things.
[Such niches are] in mosques which Allah has ordered to be raised and that His name be mentioned therein; exalting Him within them in the morning and the evenings
[Are] men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of Allah and performance of prayer and giving of zakah. They fear a Day in which the hearts and eyes will [fearfully] turn about -
That Allah may reward them [according to] the best of what they did and increase them from His bounty. And Allah gives provision to whom He wills without account.
But those who disbelieved - their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds Allah before Him, and He will pay him in full his due; and Allah is swift in account.
Or [they are] like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves, upon which are waves, over which are clouds - darknesses, some of them upon others. When one puts out his hand [therein], he can hardly see it. And he to whom Allah has not granted light - for him there is no light.
Do you not see that Allah is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and [by] the birds with wings spread [in flight]? Each [of them] has known his [means of] prayer and exalting [Him], and Allah is Knowing of what they do.
And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the destination.
Do you not see that Allah drives clouds? Then He brings them together, then He makes them into a mass, and you see the rain emerge from within it. And He sends down from the sky, mountains [of clouds] within which is hail, and He strikes with it whom He wills and averts it from whom He wills. The flash of its lightening almost takes away the eyesight.
Allah alternates the night and the day. Indeed in that is a lesson for those who have vision.
Allah has created every [living] creature from water. And of them are those that move on their bellies, and of them are those that walk on two legs, and of them are those that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.
We have certainly sent down distinct verses. And Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.
But the hypocrites say, "We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey"; then a party of them turns away after that. And those are not believers.
And when they are called to [the words of] Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, at once a party of them turns aside [in refusal].
But if the right is theirs, they come to him in prompt obedience.
Is there disease in their hearts? Or have they doubted? Or do they fear that Allah will be unjust to them, or His Messenger? Rather, it is they who are the wrongdoers.
The only statement of the [true] believers when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them is that they say, "We hear and we obey." And those are the successful.
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah and is conscious of Him - it is those who are the attainers.
And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths that if you ordered them, they would go forth [in Allah’s cause]. Say, "Do not swear. [Such] obedience is known. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with that which you do."
Say, "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away - then upon him is only that [duty] with which he has been charged, and upon you is that with which you have been charged. And if you obey him, you will be [rightly] guided. And there is not upon the Messenger except the [responsibility for] clear notification."
Allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to authority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them and that He will surely establish for them [therein] their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security, [for] they worship Me, not associating anything with Me. But whoever disbelieves after that - then those are the defiantly disobedient.
And establish prayer and give zakah and obey the Messenger - that you may receive mercy.
Never think that the disbelievers are causing failure [to Allah] upon the earth. Their refuge will be the Fire - and how wretched the destination.
O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess and those who have not [yet] reached puberty among you ask permission of you [before entering] at three times: before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing [for rest] at noon and after the night prayer. [These are] three times of privacy for you. There is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these [periods], for they continually circulate among you - some of you, among others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the verses; and Allah is Knowing and Wise.
And when the children among you reach puberty, let them ask permission [at all times] as those before them have done. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses; and Allah is Knowing and Wise.
And women of post-menstrual age who have no desire for marriage - there is no blame upon them for putting aside their outer garments [but] not displaying adornment. But to modestly refrain [from that] is better for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
There is not upon the blind [any] constraint nor upon the lame constraint nor upon the ill constraint nor upon yourselves when you eat from your [own] houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your father’s brothers or the houses of your father’s sisters or the houses of your mother’s brothers or the houses of your mother’s sisters or [from houses] whose keys you possess or [from the house] of your friend. There is no blame upon you whether you eat together or separately. But when you enter houses, give greetings of peace upon each other - a greeting from Allah, blessed and good. Thus does Allah make clear to you the verses [of ordinance] that you may understand.
The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and, when they are [meeting] with him for a matter of common interest, do not depart until they have asked his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission, [O Muhammad] - those are the ones who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for something of their affairs, then give permission to whom you will among them and ask forgiveness for them of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another. Already Allah knows those of you who slip away, concealed by others. So let those beware who dissent from the Prophet’s order, lest fitnah strike them or a painful punishment.
Unquestionably, to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth. Already He knows that upon which you [stand] and [knows] the Day when they will be returned to Him and He will inform them of what they have done. And Allah is Knowing of all things.
Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion upon His Servant that he may be to the worlds a warner -
He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and who has not taken a son and has not had a partner in dominion and has created each thing and determined it with [precise] determination.
But they have taken besides Him gods which create nothing, while they are created, and possess not for themselves any harm or benefit and possess not [power to cause] death or life or resurrection.
And those who disbelieve say, "This [Qur’an] is not except a falsehood he invented, and another people assisted him in it." But they have committed an injustice and a lie.
And they say, "Legends of the former peoples which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon."
Say, [O Muhammad], "It has been revealed by He who knows [every] secret within the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is ever Forgiving and Merciful."
And they say, "What is this messenger that eats food and walks in the markets? Why was there not sent down to him an angel so he would be with him a warner?
Or [why is not] a treasure presented to him [from heaven], or does he [not] have a garden from which he eats?" And the wrongdoers say, "You follow not but a man affected by magic."
Look how they strike for you comparisons; but they have strayed, so they cannot [find] a way.
Blessed is He who, if He willed, could have made for you [something] better than that - gardens beneath which rivers flow - and could make for you palaces.
But they have denied the Hour, and We have prepared for those who deny the Hour a Blaze.
When the Hellfire sees them from a distant place, they will hear its fury and roaring.
And when they are thrown into a narrow place therein bound in chains, they will cry out thereupon for destruction.
[They will be told], "Do not cry this Day for one destruction but cry for much destruction."
Say, "Is that better or the Garden of Eternity which is promised to the righteous? It will be for them a reward and destination.
For them therein is whatever they wish, [while] abiding eternally. It is ever upon your Lord a promise [worthy to be] requested.
And [mention] the Day He will gather them and that which they worship besides Allah and will say, "Did you mislead these, My servants, or did they [themselves] stray from the way?"
They will say, "Exalted are You! It was not for us to take besides You any allies. But You provided comforts for them and their fathers until they forgot the message and became a people ruined."
So they will deny you, [disbelievers], in what you say, and you cannot avert [punishment] or [find] help. And whoever commits injustice among you - We will make him taste a great punishment.
And We did not send before you, [O Muhammad], any of the messengers except that they ate food and walked in the markets. And We have made some of you [people] as trial for others - will you have patience? And ever is your Lord, Seeing.
And those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, "Why were not angels sent down to us, or [why] do we [not] see our Lord?" They have certainly become arrogant within themselves and [become] insolent with great insolence.
The day they see the angels - no good tidings will there be that day for the criminals, and [the angels] will say, "Prevented and inaccessible."
And We will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed.
The companions of Paradise, that Day, are [in] a better settlement and better resting place.
And [mention] the Day when the heaven will split open with [emerging] clouds, and the angels will be sent down in successive descent.
True sovereignty, that Day, is for the Most Merciful. And it will be upon the disbelievers a difficult Day.
And the Day the wrongdoer will bite on his hands [in regret] he will say, "Oh, I wish I had taken with the Messenger a way.
Oh, woe to me! I wish I had not taken that one as a friend.
He led me away from the remembrance after it had come to me. And ever is Satan, to man, a deserter."
And the Messenger has said, "O my Lord, indeed my people have taken this Qur’an as [a thing] abandoned."
And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from among the criminals. But sufficient is your Lord as a guide and a helper.
And those who disbelieve say, "Why was the Qur’an not revealed to him all at once?" Thus [it is] that We may strengthen thereby your heart. And We have spaced it distinctly.
And they do not come to you with an argument except that We bring you the truth and the best explanation.
The ones who are gathered on their faces to Hell - those are the worst in position and farthest astray in [their] way.
And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture and appointed with him his brother Aaron as an assistant.
And We said, "Go both of you to the people who have denied Our signs." Then We destroyed them with [complete] destruction.
And the people of Noah - when they denied the messengers, We drowned them, and We made them for mankind a sign. And We have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful punishment.
And [We destroyed] ‘Aad and Thamud and the companions of the well and many generations between them.
And for each We presented examples [as warnings], and each We destroyed with [total] destruction.
And they have already come upon the town which was showered with a rain of evil. So have they not seen it? But they are not expecting resurrection.
And when they see you, [O Muhammad], they take you not except in ridicule, [saying], "Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a messenger?
He almost would have misled us from our gods had we not been steadfast in [worship of] them." But they are going to know, when they see the punishment, who is farthest astray in [his] way.
Have you seen the one who takes as his god his own desire? Then would you be responsible for him?
Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? They are not except like livestock. Rather, they are [even] more astray in [their] way.
Have you not considered your Lord - how He extends the shadow, and if He willed, He could have made it stationary? Then We made the sun for it an indication.
Then We hold it in hand for a brief grasp.
And it is He who has made the night for you as clothing and sleep [a means for] rest and has made the day a resurrection.
And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy, and We send down from the sky pure water
That We may bring to life thereby a dead land and give it as drink to those We created of numerous livestock and men.
And We have certainly distributed it among them that they might be reminded, but most of the people refuse except disbelief.
And if We had willed, We could have sent into every city a warner.
So do not obey the disbelievers, and strive against them with the Qur’an a great striving.
And it is He who has released [simultaneously] the two seas, one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter, and He placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition.
And it is He who has created from water a human being and made him [a relative by] lineage and marriage. And ever is your Lord competent [concerning creation].
But they worship rather than Allah that which does not benefit them or harm them, and the disbeliever is ever, against his Lord, an assistant [to Satan].
And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.
Say, "I do not ask of you for it any payment - only that whoever wills might take to his Lord a way."
And rely upon the Ever-Living who does not die, and exalt [Allah] with His praise. And sufficient is He to be, with the sins of His servants, Acquainted -
He who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days and then established Himself above the Throne - the Most Merciful, so ask about Him one well informed.
And when it is said to them, "Prostrate to the Most Merciful," they say, "And what is the Most Merciful? Should we prostrate to that which you order us?" And it increases them in aversion.
Blessed is He who has placed in the sky great stars and placed therein a [burning] lamp and luminous moon.
And it is He who has made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude.
And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily, and when the ignorant address them [harshly], they say [words of] peace,
And those who spend [part of] the night to their Lord prostrating and standing [in prayer]
And those who say, "Our Lord, avert from us the punishment of Hell. Indeed, its punishment is ever adhering;
Indeed, it is evil as a settlement and residence."
And [they are] those who, when they spend, do so not excessively or sparingly but are ever, between that, [justly] moderate
And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.
Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated -
Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
And he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn to Allah with [accepted] repentance.
And [they are] those who do not testify to falsehood, and when they pass near ill speech, they pass by with dignity.
And those who, when reminded of the verses of their Lord, do not fall upon them deaf and blind.
And those who say, "Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us an example for the righteous."
Those will be awarded the Chamber for what they patiently endured, and they will be received therein with greetings and [words of] peace.
Abiding eternally therein. Good is the settlement and residence.
Say, "What would my Lord care for you if not for your supplication?" For you [disbelievers] have denied, so your denial is going to be adherent.
Ta, Seen, Meem.
These are the verses of the clear Book.
Perhaps, [O Muhammad], you would kill yourself with grief that they will not be believers.
If We willed, We could send down to them from the sky a sign for which their necks would remain humbled.
And no revelation comes to them anew from the Most Merciful except that they turn away from it.
For they have already denied, but there will come to them the news of that which they used to ridicule.
Did they not look at the earth - how much We have produced therein from every noble kind?
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
And [mention] when your Lord called Moses, [saying], "Go to the wrongdoing people -
The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear Allah?"
He said, "My Lord, indeed I fear that they will deny me
And that my breast will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent, so send for Aaron.
And they have upon me a [claim due to] sin, so I fear that they will kill me."
[Allah] said, "No. Go both of you with Our signs; indeed, We are with you, listening.
Go to Pharaoh and say, ‘We are the messengers of the Lord of the worlds,
[Commanded to say], "Send with us the Children of Israel."’"
[Pharaoh] said, "Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you remained among us for years of your life?
And [then] you did your deed which you did, and you were of the ungrateful."
[Moses] said, "I did it, then, while I was of those astray.
So I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Lord granted me wisdom and prophethood and appointed me [as one] of the messengers.
And is this a favor of which you remind me - that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?"
Said Pharaoh, "And what is the Lord of the worlds?"
[Moses] said, "The Lord of the heavens and earth and that between them, if you should be convinced."
[Pharaoh] said to those around him, "Do you not hear?"
[Moses] said, "Your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers."
[Pharaoh] said, "Indeed, your ‘messenger’ who has been sent to you is mad."
[Moses] said, "Lord of the east and the west and that between them, if you were to reason."
[Pharaoh] said, "If you take a god other than me, I will surely place you among those imprisoned."
[Moses] said, "Even if I brought you proof manifest?"
[Pharaoh] said, "Then bring it, if you should be of the truthful."
So [Moses] threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent manifest.
And he drew out his hand; thereupon it was white for the observers.
[Pharaoh] said to the eminent ones around him, "Indeed, this is a learned magician.
He wants to drive you out of your land by his magic, so what do you advise?"
They said, "Postpone [the matter of] him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers
Who will bring you every learned, skilled magician."
So the magicians were assembled for the appointment of a well-known day.
And it was said to the people, "Will you congregate
That we might follow the magicians if they are the predominant?"
And when the magicians arrived, they said to Pharaoh, "Is there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant?"
He said, "Yes, and indeed, you will then be of those near [to me]."
Moses said to them, "Throw whatever you will throw."
So they threw their ropes and their staffs and said, "By the might of Pharaoh, indeed it is we who are predominant."
Then Moses threw his staff, and at once it devoured what they falsified.
So the magicians fell down in prostration [to Allah].
They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,
The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
[Pharaoh] said, "You believed Moses before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic, but you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you all."
They said, "No harm. Indeed, to our Lord we will return.
Indeed, we aspire that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers."
And We inspired to Moses, "Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued."
Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers
[And said], "Indeed, those are but a small band,
And indeed, they are enraging us,
And indeed, we are a cautious society..."
So We removed them from gardens and springs
And treasures and honorable station -
Thus. And We caused to inherit it the Children of Israel.
So they pursued them at sunrise.
And when the two companies saw one another, the companions of Moses said, "Indeed, we are to be overtaken!"
[Moses] said, "No! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me."
Then We inspired to Moses, "Strike with your staff the sea," and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain.
And We advanced thereto the pursuers.
And We saved Moses and those with him, all together.
Then We drowned the others.
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
And recite to them the news of Abraham,
When he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?"
They said, "We worship idols and remain to them devoted."
He said, "Do they hear you when you supplicate?
Or do they benefit you, or do they harm?"
They said, "But we found our fathers doing thus."
He said, "Then do you see what you have been worshipping,
You and your ancient forefathers?
Indeed, they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds,
Who created me, and He [it is who] guides me.
And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink.
And when I am ill, it is He who cures me
And who will cause me to die and then bring me to life
And who I aspire that He will forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense."
[And he said], "My Lord, grant me authority and join me with the righteous.
And grant me a reputation of honor among later generations.
And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Pleasure.
And forgive my father. Indeed, he has been of those astray.
And do not disgrace me on the Day they are [all] resurrected -
The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children
But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart."
And Paradise will be brought near [that Day] to the righteous.
And Hellfire will be brought forth for the deviators,
And it will be said to them, "Where are those you used to worship
Other than Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?"
So they will be overturned into Hellfire, they and the deviators
And the soldiers of Iblees, all together.
They will say while they dispute therein,
"By Allah, we were indeed in manifest error
When we equated you with the Lord of the worlds.
And no one misguided us except the criminals.
So now we have no intercessors
And not a devoted friend.
Then if we only had a return [to the world] and could be of the believers..."
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
The people of Noah denied the messengers
When their brother Noah said to them, "Will you not fear Allah?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So fear Allah and obey me.
And I do not ask you for it any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.
So fear Allah and obey me."
They said, "Should we believe you while you are followed by the lowest [class of people]?"
He said, "And what is my knowledge of what they used to do?
Their account is only upon my Lord, if you [could] perceive.
And I am not one to drive away the believers.
I am only a clear warner."
They said, "If you do not desist, O Noah, you will surely be of those who are stoned."
He said, "My Lord, indeed my people have denied me.
Then judge between me and them with decisive judgement and save me and those with me of the believers."
So We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.
Then We drowned thereafter the remaining ones.
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
‘Aad denied the messengers
When their brother Hud said to them, "Will you not fear Allah?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So fear Allah and obey me.
And I do not ask you for it any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.
Do you construct on every elevation a sign, amusing yourselves,
And take for yourselves palaces and fortresses that you might abide eternally?
And when you strike, you strike as tyrants.
So fear Allah and obey me.
And fear He who provided you with that which you know,
Provided you with grazing livestock and children
And gardens and springs.
Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day."
They said, "It is all the same to us whether you advise or are not of the advisors.
This is not but the custom of the former peoples,
And we are not to be punished."
And they denied him, so We destroyed them. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
Thamud denied the messengers
When their brother Salih said to them, "Will you not fear Allah?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So fear Allah and obey me.
And I do not ask you for it any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.
Will you be left in what is here, secure [from death],
Within gardens and springs
And fields of crops and palm trees with softened fruit?
And you carve out of the mountains, homes, with skill.
So fear Allah and obey me.
And do not obey the order of the transgressors,
Who cause corruption in the land and do not amend."
They said, "You are only of those affected by magic.
You are but a man like ourselves, so bring a sign, if you should be of the truthful."
He said, "This is a she-camel. For her is a [time of] drink, and for you is a [time of] drink, [each] on a known day.
And do not touch her with harm, lest you be seized by the punishment of a terrible day."
But they hamstrung her and so became regretful.
And the punishment seized them. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
The people of Lot denied the messengers
When their brother Lot said to them, "Will you not fear Allah?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So fear Allah and obey me.
And I do not ask you for it any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.
Do you approach males among the worlds
And leave what your Lord has created for you as mates? But you are a people transgressing."
They said, "If you do not desist, O Lot, you will surely be of those evicted."
He said, "Indeed, I am, toward your deed, of those who detest [it].
My Lord, save me and my family from [the consequence of] what they do."
So We saved him and his family, all,
Except an old woman among those who remained behind.
Then We destroyed the others.
And We rained upon them a rain [of stones], and evil was the rain of those who were warned.
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
The companions of the thicket denied the messengers
When Shu‘ayb said to them, "Will you not fear Allah?
Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.
So fear Allah and obey me.
And I do not ask you for it any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.
Give full measure and do not be of those who cause loss.
And weigh with an even balance.
And do not deprive people of their due and do not commit abuse on earth, spreading corruption.
And fear He who created you and the former creation."
They said, "You are only of those affected by magic.
You are but a man like ourselves, and indeed, we think you are among the liars.
So cause to fall upon us fragments of the sky, if you should be of the truthful."
He said, "My Lord is most knowing of what you do."
And they denied him, so the punishment of the day of the black cloud seized them. Indeed, it was the punishment of a terrible day.
Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
And indeed, the Qur’an is the revelation of the Lord of the worlds.
The Trustworthy Spirit has brought it down
Upon your heart, [O Muhammad] - that you may be of the warners -
In a clear Arabic language.
And indeed, it is [mentioned] in the scriptures of former peoples.
And has it not been a sign to them that it is recognized by the scholars of the Children of Israel?
And even if We had revealed it to one among the foreigners
And he had recited it to them [perfectly], they would [still] not have been believers in it.
Thus have We inserted disbelief into the hearts of the criminals.
They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment.
And it will come to them suddenly while they perceive [it] not.
And they will say, "May we be reprieved?"
So for Our punishment are they impatient?
Then have you considered if We gave them enjoyment for years
And then there came to them that which they were promised?
They would not be availed by the enjoyment with which they were provided.
And We did not destroy any city except that it had warners
As a reminder; and never have We been unjust.
And the devils have not brought the revelation down.
It is not allowable for them, nor would they be able.
Indeed they, from [its] hearing, are removed.
So do not invoke with Allah another deity and [thus] be among the punished.
And warn, [O Muhammad], your closest kindred.
And lower your wing to those who follow you of the believers.
And if they disobey you, then say, "Indeed, I am disassociated from what you are doing."
And rely upon the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,
Who sees you when you arise
And your movement among those who prostrate.
Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend?
They descend upon every sinful liar.
They pass on what is heard, and most of them are liars.
And the poets - [only] the deviators follow them;
Do you not see that in every valley they roam
And that they say what they do not do? -
Except those [poets] who believe and do righteous deeds and remember Allah often and defend [the Muslims] after they were wronged. And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.
